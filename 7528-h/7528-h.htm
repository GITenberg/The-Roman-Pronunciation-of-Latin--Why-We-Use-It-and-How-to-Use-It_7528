<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> argument brought against the
‘Roman pronunciation’ of Latin is twofold: the impossibility of perfect
theoretical knowledge, and the difficulty of practical attainment.</p>

<p>If to know the main features of the classic pronunciation of Latin
were impossible, then our obvious course would be to refuse the attempt;
to regard the language as in reality dead, and to make no pretence of
reading it. This is in fact what the English scholars generally do. But
if we may know substantially the sounds of the tongue in which Cicero
spoke and Horace sung, shall we give up the delights of the melody and
the rhythm and content ourselves with the thought form? Poetry
especially does not exist apart from sound; sense alone will not
constitute it, nor even sense and form without sound.</p>

<p>But if it is true that the task of practical acquisition is, if not
impossible, extremely difficult, ‘the work of a lifetime,’ as the
objectors say, do the results justify the expenditure of time and
labor?</p>

<p>The position of the English-speaking peoples is not the same in this
as that of Europeans. Europeans have not the same necessity to urge them
to the ‘Roman pronunciation.’ Their own languages represent the Latin
more or less adequately, in vowel sounds, in accent, and even, to some
extent, in quantity; so that with them, all is not lost
<span class = "pagenum">iv</span>
if they translate the sounds into their own tongues; while with us,
nothing is left&mdash;sound, accent, quantity, all is gone; none of
these is reproduced, or even suggested, in English.</p>

<p>We believe a great part of our difficulty, in this country, lies in
the fact that so few of those who study and teach Latin really know what
the ‘Roman pronunciation’ is, or how to use it. Inquiries are constantly
being made by teachers, Why is this so? What authority is there for
this? What reason for that?</p>

<p>In the hope of giving help to those who desire to know the Why and
the How this little compendium is made; in the interest of
time-and-labor-saving uniformity, and in the belief that what cannot be
fully known or perfectly acquired does still not prevent our perceiving,
and showing in some worthy manner and to, some satisfactory degree, how,
as well as what, the honey-tongued orators and divine poets of Rome
spoke or sung.</p>

<p>In the following pages free use has been made of the highest English
authorities, of Oxford and Cambridge. Quotations will be found from
Prof. H.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;J. Munro’s pamphlet on “Pronunciation of Latin,”
and from Prof. A.&nbsp;J. Ellis’ book on “Quantitative Pronunciation of
Latin”; also from the pamphlet issued by the Cambridge (Eng.)
Philological Society, on the “Pronunciation of Latin in the Augustan
Period.”</p>

<p>In the present compendium the chief points of divergence from the
general American understanding of the ‘Roman’ method are in respect of
the diphthong <b>ae</b> and the consonantal&nbsp;<b>u</b>. In these
cases the pronunciation herein recommended for the <b>ae</b> is that
favored by Roby, Munro, and Ellis, and adopted by the Cambridge
Philological Society; for the <b>v</b>, or <b>u</b> consonant, that
advocated by Corssen, A.&nbsp;J. Ellis, and Robinson Ellis.</p>

<h2>THE ROMAN PRONUNCIATION OF LATIN.</h2>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/decline.png" width = "67" height = "7"
alt = "----"></p>

<h3><a name = "partI" id = "partI">PART I.</a><br>
<b>WHY WE USE IT.</b></h3>


<p><span class = "firstword">In</span> general, the greater part of our
knowledge of the pronunciation of Latin comes from the Latin
grammarians, whose authority varies greatly in value; or through
incidental statements and expressions of the classic writers themselves;
or from monumental inscriptions. Of these three, the first is inferior
to the other two in quality, but they in turn are comparatively meagre
in quantity.</p>

<p>In the first place, we know (a most important piece of knowledge)
that, as a rule, Latin was pronounced as written. This is evident from
the fact, among others, that the same exceptions recur, and are
mentioned over and over again, in the grammarians, and that so much is
made of comparatively, and confessedly, insignificant points. Such, we
may be sure, would not have been the case had exceptions been numerous.
Then we have the authority of Quintilian&mdash;than whom is no higher.
He speaks of the subtleties of the grammarians:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Quint. I. iv. 6.</small>] Interiora velut sacri hujus adeuntibus
apparebit multa rerum subtilitas, quae non modo acuere ingenia puerilia
sed exercere altissimam quoque eruditionem ac scientiam possit.
</blockquote>

<p>And says:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Id. ib. iv. 7.</small>] An cujuslibet auris est exigere
litterarum sonos?
</blockquote>

<p>
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
But after citing some of those idiosyncrasies which appear on the pages
of all the grammarians, he finally sums up the matter in the following
significant words:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Id. ib. vii. 30, 31.</small>] Indicium autem suum grammaticus
interponat his omnibus; nam hoc valere plurimum debet. Ego (note the
<i>ego</i>) nisi quod consuetudo obtinuerit sic scribendum quidque
judico, quomodo sonat. Hic enim est usus litterarum, ut custodiant voces
et velut depositum reddant legentibus, itaque id exprimere debent quod
dicturi sumus.
</blockquote>

<p>This is still a characteristic of the Italian language, so that one
may by books, getting the rules from the grammarians, learn to pronounce
the language with a good degree of correctness.</p>

<p>On this point Professor Munro says:</p>

<p>“We see in the first volume of the Corpus Inscr. Latin. a map, as it
were, of the language spread open before us, and feel sure that change
of spelling meant systematical change of pronunciation: <i>coira</i>,
<i>coera</i>, <i>cura</i>; <i>aiquos</i>, <i>aequos</i>, <i>aecus</i>;
<i>queicumque</i>, <i>quicumque</i>, etc., etc.”</p>

<p>And again:</p>

<p>“We know exactly how Cicero or Quintilian did or could spell; we know
the syllable on which they placed the accent of almost every word; and
in almost every case we already follow them in this. I&nbsp;have the
conviction that in their best days philological people took vast pains
to make the writing exactly reproduce the sounding; and that if
Quintilian or Tacitus spelt a word differently from Cicero or Livy, he
also spoke it so far differently.”</p>

<p>Three chief factors are essential to the Latin language, and each of
these must be known with some good degree of certainty, if we would lay
claim to an understanding of Roman pronunciation.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
<p>These are:</p>

<p>(1) Sounds of the letters (vowels, diphthongs, consonants);</p>

<p>(2) Quantity;</p>

<p>(3) Accent.</p>


<h4><a name = "why_sounds" id = "why_sounds">
<b>SOUNDS OF THE LETTERS.</b></a></h4>

<h4 class = "smallcaps"><a name = "vowels" id = "vowels">
Vowels.</a></h4>

<p>The vowels are five: <b>a</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>i</b>,
<b>o</b>,&nbsp;<b>u</b>.</p>

<p>These when uttered alone are always long.</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Pompei. <i>Comm. ad Donat.</i> Keil. v.&nbsp;V. p.&nbsp;101 et
al.</small>] Vocales autem quinque sunt: <b>a</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>i</b>,
<b>o</b>,&nbsp;<b>u</b>. Istae quinque, quando solae proferuntur, longae
sunt semper: quando solas litteras dicis, longae sunt. <b>A</b> sola
longa est; <b>e</b> sola longa est.
</blockquote>

<p><b>A</b> is uttered with the mouth widely opened, the tongue
suspended and not touching the teeth:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Ars Gram. Mar. Vict. de orthographia et de metrica ratione, I.
vi. 6.</small>] <b>A</b> littera rictu patulo, suspensa neque impressa
dentibus lingua, enuntiatur.
</blockquote>

<p><b>E</b> is uttered with the mouth less widely open, and the lips
drawn back and inward:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Id. ib. vi. 7.</small>] <b>E</b> quae sequitur, de represso
modice rictu oris, reductisque introrsum labiis, effertur.
</blockquote>

<p><b>I</b> will voice itself with the mouth half closed and the teeth
gently pressed by the tongue:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Id. ib. vi. 8.</small>] <b>I</b> semicluso ore, impressisque
sensim lingua dentibus, vocem dabit.
</blockquote>

<p><b>O</b> (long) will give the “tragic sound” through rounded opening,
with lips protruded, the tongue pendulous in the roof of the mouth:</p>

<blockquote>
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
[<small>Id. ib. vi. 9.</small>] <b>O</b> longum autem, protrusis labiis,
rictu tereti, lingua arcu oris pendula, sonum tragicum dabit.
</blockquote>

<p><b>U</b> is uttered with the lips protruding and approaching each
other, like the Greek <span class = "greek" lang = "el" title =
"ou">ου</span>:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Id. ib. vi. 10.</small>] <b>U</b> litteram quotiens enuntiamus,
productis et coeuntibus labris efferemus .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. quam nisi per
<span class = "greek" lang = "el" title = "ou">ου</span> conjunctam
Graeci scribere ac pronuntiare non possunt.
</blockquote>

<p>Of these five vowels the grammarians say that three (<b>a</b>,
<b>i</b>, <b>u</b>) do not change their quality with their quantity:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Pompei. <i>Comm. ad Donat.</i> Keil. v.&nbsp;V.
p.&nbsp;101.</small>] De istis quinque litteris tres sunt, quae sive
breves sive longae ejusdemmodi sunt, <b>a, i, u</b>: similiter habent
sive longae sive breves.
</blockquote>

<p>But two (<b>e</b>, <b>o</b>) change their quality:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Id. ib.</small>] <b>O</b> vero et <b>e</b> non sonant breves.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><b>E</b> aliter longa aliter brevis sonat. Dicit ita Terentianus (hoc
dixit) ‘Quotienscumque <b>e</b> longam volumus proferri, vicina sit ad
<b>i</b> litteram.’ Ipse sonus sic debet sonare, quomodo sonat <b>i</b>
littera. Quando dicis <i>evitat</i>, vicina debet esse, sic pressa, sic
angusta, ut vicina sit ad <b>i</b> litteram. Quando vis dicere brevem
<b>e</b> simpliciter sonat. <b>O</b> longa sit an brevis. Si longa est,
debet sonus ipse intra palatum sonare, ut si dices <i>orator</i>, quasi
intra sonat, intra palatum. Si brevis est debet primis labris sonare,
quasi extremis labris, ut puta sic dices <i>obit</i>. Habes istam
regulam expressam in Terentiano. Quando vis exprimere quia brevis est,
primis labris sonat; quando exprimis longam, intra palatum sonat.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
[<small>Ars Gram. Mar. Vict. de Orthog. et de Metr. Rat., I. vi.
9.</small>] <b>O</b> qui correptum enuntiat, nec magno hiatu labra
reserabit, et retrorsum actam linguam tenebit.
</blockquote>

<p>It would thus seem that the long <b>e</b> of the Latin in its
prolongation draws into the <b>i</b> sound, somewhat as if <b>i</b> were
subjoined, as in the English <i>vein</i> or Italian <i>fedele</i>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
<p>The grammarians speak of the obscure sound of <b>i</b> and <b>u</b>,
short and unaccented in the middle of a word; so that in a number of
words <b>i</b> and <b>u</b> were written indifferently, even by classic
writers, as <i>optimus</i> or <i>optumus</i>, <i>maximus</i> or
<i>maxumus</i>. This is but a simple and natural thing. The same
obscurity occurs often in English, as, for instance, in words ending in
<i>able</i> or <i>ible</i>. How easy, for instance, to confuse the sound
and spelling in such words as <i>detestable</i> and
<i>digestible</i>.</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Serg. Explan. Art. Donat. Keil. v.&nbsp;II.
p.&nbsp;475.</small>] Hae etiam duae <b>i</b> et <b>u</b>
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. interdum expressum suum sonum non habent: <b>i</b>, ut
<i>vir</i>; <b>u</b>, ut <i>optumus</i>. Non enim possumus dicere
<i>vir</i> producta <b>i</b>, nec <i>optumus</i> producta <b>u</b>; unde
etiam mediae dicuntur. Et hoc in commune patiuntur inter se, et bene
dixit Donatus has litteras in quibusdam dictionibus expressum suum sonum
non habere. Hae etiam mediae dicuntur, quia quibusdam dictionibus
expressum sonum non habent, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ut <i>maxume</i> pro
<i>maxime</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In quibusdam nominibus non certum
exprimunt sonum; <b>i</b>, ut <i>vir</i> modo <b>i</b> opprimitur;
<b>u</b> ut <i>optumus</i> modo <b>u</b> perdit sonum.
</blockquote>

<p>Priscian says:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;II. p.&nbsp;465.</small>] Cur per <b>vi</b>
scribitur (virum)? Quia omnia nomina a <b>vi</b> syllaba incipientia per
<b>vi</b> scribuntur exceptis <i>bitumine</i> et <i>bile</i>, quando
<i>fel</i> significat, et illis quae a <i>bis</i> adverbio componuntur,
ut <i>biceps</i>, <i>bipatens</i>, <i>bivium</i>. Cur sonum videtur
habere in hac dictione <b>i</b> vocalis <b>u</b> litterae Graecae? Quia
omnis dictio a <b>vi</b> syllaba brevi incipiens, <b>d</b> vel <b>t</b>
vel <b>m</b> vel <b>r</b> vel <b>x</b> sequentibus, hoc sono
pronuntiatur, ut <i>video</i>, <i>videbam</i>, <i>videbo</i>: quia in
his temporibus <b>vi</b> corripitur, mutavit sonum in <b>u</b>: in
praeterito autem perfecto, et in aliis in quibus producitur, naturalem
servavit sonum, ut <i>vidi</i>, <i>videram</i>, <i>vidissem</i>,
<i>videro</i>. Similiter <i>vitium</i> mutat sonum, quia corripitur;
<i>vita</i> autem non mutat, quia producitur. Similiter <i>vim</i> mutat
quia corripitur, <i>vimen</i> autem non mutat quia producitur. Similiter
<i>vir</i> et <i>virgo</i> mutant, quia corripiuntur: <i>virus</i> autem
et <i>vires</i> non mutant, quia producuntur. <i>Vix</i> mutant, quia
corripitur: <i>vixi</i> non mutant, quia producitur.
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
Hoc idem plerique solent etiam in illis dictionibus facere, in quibus a
<b>fi</b> brevi incipiunt syllabae sequentibus supra dictis
consonantibus, ut <i>fides</i>, <i>perfidus</i>, <i>confiteor</i>,
<i>infimus</i>, <i>firmus</i>. Sunt autem qui non adeo hoc observant,
cum de <b>vi</b> nemo fere dubitat.
</blockquote>

<p>From this it would seem that in the positions above mentioned
<b>vi</b> short&mdash;and with some speakers <b>fi</b> short&mdash;had
an obscure, somewhat thickened, sound, not unlike that heard in the
English words <i>virgin</i>, <i>firm</i>, a not unnatural obscuration.
As Donatus says of it:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;IV. p.&nbsp;367.</small>] Pingue nescio quid pro
naturali sono usurpamus.
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes, apparently, this tendency ran into excess, and the long
<b>i</b> was also obscured; while sometimes the short <b>i</b> was
pronounced too distinctly. This vice is commented on by the grammarians,
under the name <i>iotacism</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Pompei. Comm. ad Donat. Keil. v.&nbsp;V. p.&nbsp;394.</small>]
<i>Iotacismum</i> dicunt vitium quod per <b>i</b> litteram vel pinguius
vel exilius prolatam fit. Galli pinguius hanc utuntur, ut cum dicunt
<i>ite</i>, non expresse ipsam proferentes, sed inter <b>e</b> et
<b>i</b> pinguiorem sonum nescio quem ponentes. Graeci exilius hanc
proferunt, adeo expressioni ejus tenui studentes, ut si dicant
<i>jus</i>, aliquantulum de priori littera sic proferant, ut videas
dissyllabam esse factam. Romanae linguae in hoc erit moderatio, ut
exilis ejus sonus sit, ubi ab ea verbum incipit, ut <i>ite</i>, aut
pinguior, ubi in ea desinit verbum, ut <i>habui</i>, <i>tenui</i>;
medium quendam sonum inter <b>e</b> et <b>i</b> habet, ubi in medio
sermone est, ut <i>hominem</i>. Mihi tamen videtur, quando producta est,
plenior vel acutior esse; quando autem brevis est medium sonum exhibere
debet, sicut eadem exempla quae posita sunt possunt declarare.
</blockquote>

<p>The grammarians also note the peculiar relation of <b>u</b> to
<b>q</b>, as in the following passage:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Serg. Explan. Art. Donat. Keil. v.&nbsp;IV.
p.&nbsp;475.</small>] <b>U</b> vero hoc accidit proprium, ut interdum
nec vocalis nec consonans sit, hoc est ut non
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
sit littera, cum inter <b>q</b> et aliquam vocalem ponitur. Nam
consonans non potest esse, quia ante se habet alteram consonantem, id
est <b>q</b>; vocalis esse non potest, quia sequitur illam vocalis, ut
<i>quare</i>, <i>quomodo</i>.
</blockquote>


<h4 class = "smallcaps"><a name = "diphthongs" id = "diphthongs">
Diphthongs.</a></h4>

<p>In Marius Victorinus we find diphthongs thus defined:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Mar. Vict. Gaisford, I. v. 54.</small>] Duae inter se vocales
jugatae ac sub unius vocis enuntiatione prolatae syllabam faciunt natura
longam, quam Graeci <i>diphthongon</i> vocant, veluti geminae vocis unum
sonum, ut <b>ae</b>, <b>oe</b>,&nbsp;<b>au</b>.
</blockquote>

<p>And more fully in the following paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Mar. Vict. Gaisford, I. v. 6.</small>] Sunt longae naturaliter
syllabae, cum duae vocales junguntur, quas syllabas Graeci
<i>diphthongos</i> vocant; ut <b>ae</b>, <b>oe</b>, <b>au</b>,
<b>eu</b>, <b>ei</b>: nam illae diphthongi non sunt quae fiunt per
vocales loco consonantium positas; ut <b>ia</b>, <b>ie</b>, <b>ii</b>,
<b>io</b>, <b>iu</b>, <b>va</b>, <b>ve</b>, <b>vi</b>,
<b>vo</b>,&nbsp;<b>vu</b>.
</blockquote>

<p>Of these diphthongs <b>eu</b> occurs,&mdash;except in Greek
words,&mdash;only in <i>heus</i>, <i>heu</i>, <i>eheu</i>; in
<i>seu</i>, <i>ceu</i>, <i>neu</i>. In <i>neuter</i> and
<i>neutiquam</i> the <b>e</b> is probably elided.</p>

<p>Diphthongs ending in <b>i</b>, viz., <b>ei</b>, <b>oi</b>, <b>ui</b>,
occur only in a few interjections and in cases of contraction.</p>

<p>While in pronouncing the diphthong the sound of both vowels was to
some extent preserved, there are many indications that
(in&nbsp;accordance with the custom of making a vowel before another
vowel short) the first vowel of the diphthong was hastened over and the
second received the stress. As in modern Greek we find all diphthongs
that end in <i>iota</i> pronounced as simple <b>i</b>, so in Latin there
are numerous instances, before and during the classic period, of the use
of <b>e</b> for <b>ae</b> or <b>oe</b>, and it is to be noted that in
the latest spelling <b>e</b> generally prevails.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
<p>Munro says:</p>

<p>“In Lucilius’s time the rustics said <i>Cecilius pretor</i> for
<i>Caecilius praetor</i>; in two Samothracian inscriptions older than
<span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span> 100 (the sound of <b>ai</b> by
that time verging to an open <b>e</b>), we find <i>muste piei</i> and
<i>muste</i>: in similar inscriptions <span class = "greek" lang = "el"
title = "mustai">μύσται</span> piei, and <i>mystae</i>: <i>Paeligni</i>
is reproduced in Strabo by <span class = "greek" lang = "el" title =
"Pelignoi">Πελιγνόι</span>: Cicero, Virgil, Festus, and Servius all
alike give <i>caestos</i> for <span class = "greek" lang = "el" title =
"kestos">κεστός</span>: by the first century, perhaps sooner, <b>e</b>
was very frequently put for <b>ae</b> in words like <i>taeter</i>: we
often find <i>teter</i>, <i>erumna</i>, <i>mestus</i>, <i>presto</i> and
the like: soon inscriptions and MSS. began pertinaciously to offer
<b>ae</b> for <b>ĕ</b>: <i>praetum</i>, <i>praeces</i>,
<i>quaerella</i>, <i>aegestas</i> and the like, the <b>ae</b>
representing a short and very open <b>e</b>: sometimes it stands for a
long <b>e</b>, as often in <i>plaenus</i>, the liquid before and after
making perhaps the <b>e</b> more open (<span class = "greek" lang = "el"
title = "skênê">σκηνή</span> is always <i>scaena</i>): and it is from
this form <i>plaenus</i> that in Italian, contrary to the usual law of
long Latin <b>e</b>, we have <i>pièno</i> with open&nbsp;<b>e</b>. With
such pedigree then, and with the genuine Latin <b>ae</b> <i>always</i>
represented in Italian by open <b>e</b>, can we hesitate to pronounce
the <b>ae</b> with this open <b>e</b> sound?”</p>

<p>The argument sometimes used, for pronouncing <b>ae</b> like
<b>ai</b>, that in the poets we occasionally find <b>ai</b> in the
genitive singular of the first declension, appears to have little weight
in view of the following explanation:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Mar. Vict, de Orthog. et de Metr. Rat., I. iii. 38.</small>]
<b>Ae</b> Syllabam quidam more Graecorum per <b>ai</b> scribunt, nec
illud quidem custodient, quia omnes fere, qui de orthographia aliquid
scriptum reliquerunt, praecipiunt, nomina femina casu nominativo
<b>a</b> finita, numero plurali in <b>ae</b> exire, ut <i>Aeliae</i>:
eadem per <b>a</b> et <b>i</b> scripta numerum singularem ostendere, ut
hujus <i>Aeliai</i>: inducti a poetis, qui <i>pictai vestis</i>
scripserunt: et quia Graeci per <b>i</b> potissimum hanc syllabam
scribunt propter exilitatem litterae, <span class = "greek" lang = "el"
title = "Greek letter eta">η</span> autem propter naturalem productionem
jungere vocali alteri non possunt: <i>iota</i> vero, quae est
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
brevis eademque longa, aptior ad hanc structuram visa est: quam
potestatem apud nos habet et <b>i</b>, quae est longa et brevis. Vos
igitur sine controversia ambiguitatis, et pluralem nominativum, et
singularem genitivum per <b>ae</b> scribite: nam qui non potest
dignoscere supra scriptarum vocum numeros et casum, valde est hebes.
</blockquote>

<p>Of <b>oe</b> Munro says:</p>

<p>“When hateful barbarisms like <i>coelum</i>, <i>coena</i>,
<i>moestus</i> are eliminated, <b>oe</b> occurs very rarely in Latin:
<i>coepi</i>, <i>poena</i>, <i>moenia</i>, <i>coetus</i>,
<i>proelia</i>, besides archaisms <i>coera</i>, <i>moerus</i>, etc.,
where <b>oe</b>, coming from <b>oi</b>, passed into&nbsp;<b>u</b>. If we
must have a simple sound, I&nbsp;should take the open <b>e</b> sound
which I have given to <b>ae</b>: but I should prefer one like the
German&nbsp;<b>ö</b>. Their rarity, however, makes the sound of
<b>oe</b>, <b>eu</b>, <b>ui</b> of less importance.”</p>

<p>Of <b>au</b> Munro says:</p>

<p>“Here, too, <b>au</b> has a curious analogy with <b>ae</b>: The Latin
au becomes in Italian open <b>o</b>: <i>òro òde</i>: I would pronounce
thus in Latin: <i>plòstrum</i>, <i>Clòdius</i>, <i>còrus</i>. Perhaps,
too, the fact that <i>gloria</i>, <i>vittoria</i> and the common
termination <i>-orio</i>, have in Italian the open <b>o</b>, might show
that the corresponding <b>ō</b> in Latin was open by coming between two
liquids, or before one: compare <i>plenus</i> above.” “I&nbsp;should
prefer,” he says, (to&nbsp;represent the Latin <b>au</b>,) “the Italian
<b>au</b>, which gives more of the <b>u</b> than our <i>owl</i>,
<i>cow</i>.”</p>


<h4 class = "smallcaps"><a name = "consonants" id = "consonants">
Consonants.</a></h4>

<p><b>B</b> has, in general, the same sound as in English.</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Mar. Vict. Keil. v.&nbsp;VI. p.&nbsp;32.</small>] E quibus
<b>b</b> et <b>p</b> litterae .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dispari inter se oris
officio exprimuntur. Nam prima exploso e mediis labiis sono, sequens
compresso ore velut introrsum attracto vocis ictu explicatur.
</blockquote>

<p>
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
<b>B</b> before <b>s</b> or <b>t</b> is sharpened to <b>p</b>: thus
<i>urbs</i> is pronounced <i>urps</i>; <i>obtinuit</i>, <i>optinuit</i>.
Some words, indeed, are written either way; as <i>obses</i>, or
<i>opses</i>; <i>obsonium</i>, or <i>opsonium</i>; <i>obtingo</i>, or
<i>optingo</i>; and Quintilian says it is a question whether the change
should be indicated in writing or not:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Quint. I. vii. 7.</small>] Quaeri solet, in scribendo
praepositiones, sonum quern junctae efficiunt an quem separatae,
observare conveniat: ut cum dico <i>obtinuit</i>, secundam enim <b>b</b>
litteram ratio poscit, aures magis audiunt&nbsp;<b>p</b>.
</blockquote>

<p>This change, however, is both so slight and so natural that attention
need scarcely be called to it. Indeed if quantity is properly observed,
one can hardly go wrong. If, for instance, you attempt, in saying
<i>obtinuit</i>, to give its normal sound to <b>b</b>, you can scarcely
avoid making a false quantity (the first syllable too long), while if
you observe the quantity (first syllable short) your <b>b</b> will
change itself to&nbsp;<b>p</b>.</p>

<p><b>C</b> appears to have but one sound, the hard, as in
<i>sceptic</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Mar. Vict. Keil. v.&nbsp;VI. p.&nbsp;32.</small>] <b>C</b> etiam
et .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <b>G</b> sono proximae, oris molimine nisuque
dissentiunt. Nam <b>c</b> reducta introrsum lingua hinc atque hinc
molares urgens haerentem intra os sonum vocis excludit: <b>g</b> vim
prioris pari linguae habitu palato suggerens lenius reddit.
</blockquote>

<p>Not only do we find no hint in the grammarians of any sound akin to
the soft <b>c</b> in English, as in <i>sceptre</i>, but they all speak
of <b>c</b> and <b>k</b> and <b>q</b> as identical, or substantially so,
in sound; and Quintilian expressly states that the sound of <b>c</b> is
always the same. Speaking of <b>k</b> as superfluous, he says:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Quint. I. vii. 10.</small>] Nam <b>k</b> quidem in nullis verbis
utendum puto, nisi quae significat, etiam ut sola ponatur. Hoc eo non
omisi, quod quidam eam quotiens a sequatur necessariam credunt, cum sit
<b>c</b> littera, quae ad omnes vocales vim suam perferat.
</blockquote>

<p>
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
And Priscian declares:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;II. p.&nbsp;13.</small>] Quamvis in varia figura
et vario nomine sint <b>k</b> et <b>q</b> et <b>c</b>, tamen quia unam
vim habent tam in metro quam in sono, pro una littera accipi debent.
</blockquote>

<p>Without the best of evidence we should hardly believe that words
written indifferently with <b>ae</b> or <b>e</b> after <b>c</b> would be
so differently pronounced by those using the diphthong and those using
the simple vowel, that, to take the instance already given, in the time
of Lucilius, the rustic said <i>Sesilius</i> for <i>Kaekilius</i>. Nor
does it seem probable that in different cases the same word would vary
so greatly, or that in the numerous compounds where after <b>c</b> the
<b>a</b> weakens to <b>i</b> the sound of the <b>c</b> was also changed
from <b>k</b> to <b>s</b>, as “<i>kapio</i>” “<i>insipio</i>”;
“<i>kado</i>,” “<i>insido</i>.”</p>

<p>Quintilian, noting the changes of fashion in the sounding of the
<b>h</b>, enumerates, among other instances of excessive use of the
aspirate, the words <i>choronae</i> (for <i>coronae</i>),
<i>chenturiones</i> (for <i>centuriones</i>), <i>praechones</i> (for
<i>praecones</i>), as if the three words were alike in their initial
sound.</p>

<p>Alluding to inscriptions (first volume), where we have <i>pulcher</i>
and <i>pulcer</i>, <i>Gracchis</i> and <i>Graccis</i>, Mr. Munro says:
“I&nbsp;do not well see how the aspirate could have been attached to the
<b>c</b>, if <b>c</b> had not a <b>k</b> sound, or how in this case
<b>c</b> before <b>e</b> or <b>i</b> could have differed from <b>c</b>
before <b>a</b>, <b>o</b>,&nbsp;<b>u</b>.”</p>

<p>Professor Munro also cites an inscription (844 of the “Corpus
Inscr.,” vol.&nbsp;I.) bearing on the case in another way. In this
inscription we have the word <i>dekembres</i>. “This,” says Mr. Munro,
“is one of nearly two hundred short, plebeian, often half-barbarous,
very old inscriptions on a collection of ollae. The <b>k</b> before
<b>e</b>, or any letter except <b>a</b>, is solecistic, just as in no.
831 is the <b>c</b>, instead of <b>k</b>, for <i>calendas</i>. From this
I would infer that, as in the latter
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
the writer saw no difference between <b>c</b> and <b>k</b>, so to the
writer of the former <b>k</b> was the same as <b>c</b>
before&nbsp;<b>e</b>.”</p>

<p>Again he says:</p>

<p>“And finally, what is to me most convincing of all, I do not well
understand how in a people of grammarians, when for seven hundred years,
from Ennius to Priscian, the most distinguished writers were also the
most minute philologers, not one, so far as we know, should have hinted
at any difference, if such existed.”</p>

<p>As to the peculiar effect of <b>c</b> final in certain particles to
“lengthen” the vowel before it, this <b>c</b> is doubtless the remnant
of the intensive enclitic <b>ce</b>, and the so-called ‘length’ is not
in the vowel, but in the more forcible utterance of the&nbsp;<b>c</b>.
It is true that Priscian says:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;II. p.&nbsp;34.</small>] Notandum, quod ante hanc
solam mutam finalem inveniuntur longae vocales, ut <i>hōc</i>,
<i>hāc</i>, <i>sīc</i>, <i>hīc</i> adverbium.
</blockquote>

<p>And Probus speaks of <b>c</b> as often prolonging the vowel before
it. But Victorinus, more philosophically, attributes the length to the
“double” sound of the consonant:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Mar. Vict. I. v. 46.</small>] Consideranda ergo est in his
duntaxat pronominibus natura <b>c</b> litterae, quae crassum quodammodo
et quasi geminum sonum reddat, <i>hic</i> et <i>hoc</i>.
</blockquote>

<p>And he adds that you do not get that more emphatic sound in, for
instance, the conjunction <i>nec</i>.</p>

<blockquote>
Si autem <i>nec</i> conjunctionem aspiciamus, licet eadem littera
finitam, diversum tamen sonabit.
</blockquote>

<p>And again:</p>

<blockquote>
Ut dixi, in pronominibus c littera sonum efficit crassiorem.
</blockquote>

<p>Pompeius, commenting upon certain vices of speech, says that some
persons bring out the final <b>c</b> in certain words too heavily,
pronouncing <i>sic ludit</i> as <i>sic cludit</i>; while others, on
<span class = "pagenum">13</span>
the contrary, touch it so lightly that when the following word begins
with <b>c</b> you hear but a single <b>c</b>:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;V. p.&nbsp;394.</small>] Item litteram <b>c</b>
quidam in quibusdam dictionibus non latine ecferunt, sed ita crasse, ut
non discernas quid dicant: ut puta siquis dicat <i>sic ludit</i>, ita
hoc loquitur ut putes eum in secunda parte orationis <i>cludere</i>
dixisse, non <i>ludere</i>: et item si contra dicat illud contrarium
putabis. Alii contra ita subtiliter hoc ecferunt, ut cum duo <b>c</b>
habeant, desinentis prioris partis orationis et incipientis alterius,
sic loquantur quasi uno <b>c</b> utrumque explicent, ut dicunt multi
<i>sic custodit</i>.
</blockquote>

<p><b>D</b>, in general, is pronounced as in English, except that the
tongue should touch the teeth rather than the palate.</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Pompei. <i>Comm. ad Donat.</i> Keil. v.&nbsp;VI.
p.&nbsp;32.</small>] <b>D</b> autem et <b>t</b> quibus, ut ita dixerim,
vocis vicinitas quaedam est, linguae sublatione ac positione
distinguuntur. Nam cum summos atque imos conjunctim dentes suprema sui
parte pulsaverit <b>d</b> litteram exprimit. Quotiens autem sublimata
partem, qua superis dentibus est origo, contigerit <b>t</b> sonare vocis
explicabit.
</blockquote>

<p>But when certain words in common use ending in <b>d</b> were followed
by words beginning with a consonant, the sound of the <b>d</b> was
sharpened to <b>t</b>; and indeed the word was often, especially by the
earlier writers, written with <b>t</b>, as, for instance, <i>set</i>,
<i>haut</i>, <i>aput</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Mar. Vict. I. iii. 50.</small>] <b>D</b> tamen litteram
conservat si sequens verbum incipiat a vocali; ut <i>haud aliter
muros</i>; et <i>haud equidem</i>. At cum verbum a consonante incipit,
<b>d</b> perdit, <i>ut haut dudum</i>, et <i>haut multum</i>, et <i>haut
placitura refert</i>, et inducit&nbsp;<b>t</b>.
</blockquote>

<p><b>F</b> is pronounced as in English except that it should be brought
out more forcibly, with more breath.</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;VI. p.&nbsp;31.</small>] <b>F</b> litteram imum
labium superis imprimentibus dentibus, reflexa ad palati fastigium
lingua, leni spiramine proferemus.
</blockquote>

<p>
<span class = "pagenum">14</span>
Marius Victorinus says that <b>f</b> was used in Latin words as
<b>ph</b> in foreign.</p>

<p>Diomedes (of the fourth century) says the same:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Diom. Keil. v.&nbsp;I. p.&nbsp;422.</small>] Id hoc scire
debemus quod <b>f</b> littera tum scribitur cum Latina dictio scribitur,
ut <i>felix</i>. Nam si peregrina fuerit, <b>p</b> et <b>h</b>
scribimus, ut <i>Phoebus</i>, <i>Phaethon</i>.
</blockquote>

<p>And Priscian makes a similar statement:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Prisc. Keil. v.&nbsp;I. p.&nbsp;35.</small>] <b>F</b> multis
modis muta magis ostenditur, cum pro <b>p</b> et aspiratione, quae
similiter muta est, accipitur.
</blockquote>

<p>From the following words of Quintilian we may judge the breathing to
have been quite pronounced:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Quint. XII. x. 29.</small>] Nam et ilia quae est sexta
nostrarum, paene non humana voce, vel omnino non voce, potius inter
discrimina dentium efflanda est, quae etiam cum vocalem proxima accipit
quassa quodammodo, utique quotiens aliquam consonantem frangit, ut in
hoc ipso <i>frangit</i>, multo fit horridior.
</blockquote>

<p><b>G</b>, no less than <b>c</b>, appears to have had but one sound,
the hard, as in the English word <i>get</i>.</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Mar. Vict. Keil. v.&nbsp;VI. p.&nbsp;32.</small>] <b>C</b> etiam
et <b>g</b>, ut supra scriptae, sono proximae, oris molimine nisuque
dissentiunt. Nam <b>c</b> reducta introrsum lingua, hinc atque hinc
molares urgens, haerentem intra os sonum vocis excludit: <b>g</b> vim
prioris, pari linguae habitu palato suggerens, lenius reddit.
</blockquote>

<p>Diomedes speaks of <b>g</b> as a new consonant, whose place had
earlier been filled by <b>c</b>:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;I. p.&nbsp;423.</small>] <b>G</b> nova est
consonans, in cujus locum <b>c</b> solebat adponi, sicut hodieque cum
Gaium notamus Caesarem, scribimus <b>C.&nbsp;C.</b>, ideoque etiam post
<b>b</b> litteram, id est tertio loco, digesta est, ut apud Graecos
<span class = "greek" lang = "el" title = "Greek letter gamma">γ</span>
posita reperitur in eo loco.
</blockquote>

<p>
<span class = "pagenum">15</span>
Victorinus thus refers to the old custom still in use of writing
<b>C</b> and <b>Cn</b>, as initials, in certain names, even where the
names were pronounced as with&nbsp;<b>G</b>.</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Mar. Vict. I. iii. 98.</small>] <b>C</b> autem et nomen habuisse
<b>g</b> et usum praestitisse, quod nunc <i>Caius</i> per <b>C</b>, et
<i>Cneius</i> per <b>Cn</b>, quamvis utrimque syllabae sonus <b>g</b>
exprimat, scribuntur.
</blockquote>

<p><b>H</b> has the same sound as in English. The grammarians never
regarded it as a consonant,&mdash;at least in more than name,&mdash;but
merely as representing the rough breathing of the Greeks.</p>

<p>Victorinus thus speaks of its nature:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;VI. p.&nbsp;32.</small>] <b>H</b> quoque inter
litteras obviam grammatici tradiderunt, eamque adspirationis notam
cunctis vocalibus praefici; ipsi autem consonantes tantum quattuor
praeponi, quotiens graecis nominibus latina forma est, persuaserunt, id
est <b>c</b>, <b>p</b>, <b>r</b>, <b>t</b>; ut <i>chori</i>,
<i>Phyllis</i>, <i>rhombos</i>, <i>thymos</i>; quae profundo spiritu,
anhelis faucibus, exploso ore, fundetur.
</blockquote>

<p>By the best authorities <b>h</b> was looked upon as a mere mark of
aspiration. Victorinus says that Nigidius Figulus so regarded it:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Mar. Vict. I. iv. 5.</small>] Idem (N.&nbsp;F.) <b>h</b> non
esse litteram, sed notam adspirationis tradidit.
</blockquote>

<p>There appears to have been the same difference of opinion and usage
among the Romans as with us in the matter of sounding
the&nbsp;<b>h</b>.</p>

<p>Quintilian says that the fashion changed with the age:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Quint. I. v. 19, 20, 21.</small>] Cujus quidem ratio mutata cum
temporibus est saepius. Parcissime ea veteres usi etiam in vocalibus,
cum <i>oedus vicos</i>que dicebant, diu deinde servatum ne consonantibus
aspirarent, ut in <i>Graecis</i> et in <i>triumpis</i>; erupit brevi
tempore nimius usus, ut <i>choronae</i>, <i>chenturiones</i>,
<i>praechones</i>, adhuc quibusdam inscriptionibus maneant, qua de re
Catulli nobile epigramma
<span class = "pagenum">16</span>
est. Inde durat ad nos usque <i>vehementer</i>, et <i>comprehendere</i>,
et <i>mihi</i>, nam <i>mehe</i> quoque pro me apud antiquos tragoediarum
praecipue scriptores in veteribus libris invenimus.
</blockquote>

<p>In the epigram above referred to Catullus thus satirizes the
excessive use of the aspirate:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Catullus lxxxiv.</small>]
</blockquote>

<div class = "verse">
<p>Chommoda dicebat, si quando commoda vellet</p>

<p class = "indent">Jam non Ionios esse, sed Hionios.</p>
</div>

<p>On the other hand Quintilian seems disposed to smile at the excess of
‘culture’ which drops its <b>h</b>’s, to class this with other affected
‘niceties’ of speech, and to regard the whole matter as of slight
importance:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Quint. I. vi. 21, 22.</small>] Multum enim litteratus, qui sine
aspiratione et producta secunda syllaba salutarit (<i>avere</i> est
enim), et <i>calefacere</i> dixerit potius quam quod dicimus, et
<i>conservavisse</i>; his adjiciat <i>face</i> et <i>dice</i> et
similia. Recta est haec via, quis negat? sed adjacet mollior et magis
trita.
</blockquote>

<p>Cicero confesses that he himself changed his practice in regard to
the aspirate. He had been accustomed to sound it only with vowels, and
to follow the fathers, who never used it with a consonant; but at
length, yielding to the importunity of his ear, he conceded the right of
usage to the people, and ‘kept his learning to himself.’</p>

<blockquote>
<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
[<small>Cic. Or. XLVIII. 160.</small>] Quin ego ipse, cum scirem ita
majores locutos esse ut nusquam nisi in vocali aspiratione uterentur,

<i>Kartaginem</i>, dicerem; aliquando, idque sero, convicio aurium cum
extorta mihi veritas, usum loquendi populo concessi, scientiam mihi
reservavi.
</blockquote>

<p>Gellius speaks of the ancients as having employed the <b>h</b> merely
to add a certain force and life to the word, in imitation of the Attic
tongue, and enumerates some of these words. Thus, he says, they said
<i>lachrymas</i>; thus, <i>sepulchrum</i>, <i>aheneum</i>,
<i>vehemens</i>, <i>inchoare</i>, <i>helvari</i>, <i>hallucinari</i>,

<blockquote>
[<small>Gellius II. iii.</small>] In his enim verbis omnibus litterae,

vocis, quasi quibusdam nervis additis, intenderetur.
</blockquote>

<p>And he tells an interesting anecdote about a manuscript of
Vergil:</p>

<blockquote>
Sed quoniam <i>aheni</i> quoque exemplo usi sumus, venit nobis in
memoriam, fidum optatumque, multi nominis Romae, grammaticum ostendisse
mihi librum Aeneidos secundum mirandae vetustatis, emptum in Sigillariis
XX. aureis, quem ipsius Vergilii fuisse credebat; in quo duo isti versus
cum ita scripti forent:
</blockquote>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Vestibulum ante ipsum, primoque in limine, Pyrrhus:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Exultat telis, et luce coruscus aëna.”</p>
</div>

<blockquote>
Additam supra vidimus <b>h</b> litteram, et <i>ahena</i> factum. Sic in
illo quoque Vergilii versu in optimis libris scriptum invenimus:
</blockquote>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Aut foliis undam tepidi dispumat aheni.”</p>
</div>

<p><b>I</b> consonant has the sound of <b>i</b> in the English word
<i>onion</i>.</p>

<p>The grammarians all express themselves in nearly the same terms as to
its character:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Serg. Explan. in Art. Donat. Keil. v.&nbsp;IV.
p.&nbsp;520.</small>] <b>I</b> et <b>u</b> varias habent potestates: nam
sunt aliquando vocales, aliquando consonantes, aliquando mediae,
aliquando nihil, aliquando digammae, aliquando duplices. Vocales sunt
quando aut singulae positae syllabam
<span class = "pagenum">18</span>
faciunt aut aliis consonantibus sociantur, ut <i>Iris</i> et <i>unus</i>
et <i>Isis</i> et <i>urna</i>. Consonantes autem sunt, cum aliis
vocalibus in una syllaba praeponuntur, aut cum ipsae inter se in una
syllaba conjunguntur. Nisi enim et prior sit et in una syllaba secum
habeat conjunctam vocalem, non erit consonans <b>i</b>
vel&nbsp;<b>u</b>. Nam <i>Iulius</i> et <i>Iarbas</i> cum dicis,
<b>i</b> consonans non est, licet praecedat, quia in una syllaba secum
non habet conjunctam vocalem, sed in altera consequentem.
</blockquote>

<p>The grammarians speak of <b>i</b> consonant as different in sound and
effect from the vowel <b>i</b>; and, as they do not say how it differs,
we naturally infer the variation to be that which follows in the nature
of things from its position and office, as in the kindred Romance
languages.</p>

<p>Priscian says:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;II. p.&nbsp;13.</small>] Sic <b>i</b> et <b>u</b>,
quamvis unum nomen et unam habeant figuram tam vocales quam consonantes,
tamen, quia diversum sonum et diversam vim habent in metris et in
pronuntiatione syllabarum, non sunt in eisdem meo judicio elementis
accipiendae, quamvis et Censorino, doctissimo artis grammaticae, idem
placuit.
</blockquote>

<p>It would seem to be by reason of this twofold nature (vowel and
consonant) that <b>i</b> has its ‘lengthening’ power. Probus explains
the matter thus:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;IV. p.&nbsp;220.</small>] Praeterea vim naturamque
<b>i</b> litterae vocalis plenissime debemus cognoscere, quod duarum
interdum loco consonantium ponatur. Hanc enim ex suo numero vocales
duplicem litteram mittunt, ut cetera elementa litterarum singulas
duplices mittunt, de quibus suo disputavimus loco. Illa ergo ratione
<b>i</b> littera duplicem sonum designat, una quamvis figura sit, si
undique fuerit cincta vocalibus, ut <i>acerrimus Aiax</i>, et
</blockquote>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Aio te, Eacida, Romanos vincere posse.”</p>
</div>

<p>Again in the commentaries on Donatus we find:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;IV. p.&nbsp;421.</small>] Plane sciendum est quod
<b>i</b> inter duas posita vocales in una parte orationis pro duabus est
consonantibus, ut <i>Troia</i>.
</blockquote>

<p>
<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
Priscian tells us that earlier it was, as we know, the custom to write
two <b>i</b>’s:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;III. p.&nbsp;467.</small>] Antiqui solebant duas
<b>ii</b> scribere, et alteram priori subjungere, alteram praeponere
sequenti, ut <i>Troiia</i>, <i>Maiia</i>, <i>Aiiax</i>.
</blockquote>

<p>And Quintilian says:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Quint. I. iv. II.</small>] Sciat etiam Ciceroni placuisse
<i>aiio Maiiam</i>que geminata <b>i</b> scribere.
</blockquote>

<p>This doubling of the sound of <b>i</b>, natural, even unavoidable,
between vowels, gives us the consonant effect (as&nbsp;vowel, uniting
with the preceding, as consonant, introducing the following, vowel).</p>

<p><b>K</b> has the same sound as in English.</p>

<p>The grammarians generally agree that <b>k</b> is a superfluous, or at
least unnecessary, letter, its place being filled by&nbsp;<b>c</b>.
Diomedes says:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;I. pp.&nbsp;423, 424.</small>] Ex his quibusdam
supervacuae videntur <b>k</b> et <b>q</b>, quod <b>c</b> littera harum
locum possit implere.
</blockquote>

<p>And again:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>K</b> consonans muta supervacua, qua utimur quando <b>a</b>
correpta sequitur, ut <i>Kalendae</i>, <i>caput</i>,
<i>calumniae</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its only use is as an initial and sign of certain words, and it is
followed by short <b>a</b> only.</p>

<p>Victorinus says:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>I. iii. 23.</small>] <b>K</b> autem dicitur monophonos, quia
nulli vocali jungitur nisi soli <b>a</b> brevi: et hoc ita ut ab ea pars
orationis incipit, aliter autem non recte scribitur.
</blockquote>

<p>Priscian says:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;II. p.&nbsp;36.</small>] <b>K</b> supervacua est,
ut supra diximus: quae quamvis scribetur nullam aliam vim habet
quam&nbsp;<b>c</b>.
</blockquote>

<p>
<span class = "pagenum">20</span>
And Quintilian speaks of it as a mere sign, but says some think it
should be used when <b>a</b> follows, as initial:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Quint. I. iv. 9.</small>] Et <b>k</b>, quae et ipsa quorundam
nominum nota est.
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Quint. I. vii. 10.</small>] Nam <b>k</b> quidem in nullis verbis
utendum puto nisi quae significat etiam ut sola ponatur. Hoc eo non
omisi quod quidam eam quotiens <b>a</b> sequatur necessariam credunt,
cum sit <b>c</b> littera, quae ad omnes vocales vim suam perferat.
</blockquote>

<p>This use of <b>k</b>, as an initial, and in certain words, was
regarded somewhat in the light of a literary ‘fancy.’ Priscian says
of&nbsp;it:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;II. p.&nbsp;12.</small>] Et <b>k</b> quidem
penitus supervacua est; nulla enim videtur ratio cur <b>a</b> sequente
haec scribi debeat: <i>Carthago</i> enim et <i>caput</i> sive per
<b>c</b> sive per <b>k</b> scribantur nullam faciunt nec in sono nec in
potestate ejusdem consonantis differentiam.
</blockquote>

<p><b>L</b> is pronounced as in English, only more distinctly and with
the tongue more nearly approaching the teeth. The sound is thus given by
Victorinus:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;VI. p.&nbsp;32.</small>] Sequetur <b>l</b>, quae
validum nescio quid partem palati qua primordium dentibus superis est
lingua trudente, diducto ore personabit.
</blockquote>

<p>But it varies according to its position in the force and distinctness
with which it is uttered.</p>

<p>Pliny and others recognize three degrees of force:</p>

<p>Priscian says:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;II. p.&nbsp;29.</small>] <b>L</b> triplicem, ut
Plinius videtur, sonum habet: exilem, quando geminatur secundo loco
posita, ut <i>ille</i>, <i>Metellus</i>; plenum, quando finit nomina vel
syllabas, et quando aliquam habet ante se in eadem syllaba consonantem,
ut <i>sol</i>, <i>silva</i>, <i>flavus</i>, <i>clarus</i>; medium in
aliis, ut <i>lectum</i>, <i>lectus</i>.
</blockquote>

<p>
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
Pompeius, in his commentaries on Donatus, makes nearly the same
statement, when treating of ‘<i>labdacism</i>’:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;V. p.&nbsp;394.</small>] <i>Labdacismum</i> vitium
in eo esse dicunt quod eadem littera vel subtilius, a&nbsp;quibusdam,
vel pinguius, ecfertur. Et re vera alterutrum vitium quibusdam gentibus
est. Nam ecce Graeci subtiliter hunc sonum ecferunt. Ubi enim dicunt
<i>ille mihi dixit</i> sic sonat duae <b>ll</b> primae syllabae quasi
per unum <b>l</b> sermo ipse consistet. Contra alii sic pronuntiant
<i>ille meum comitatus iter</i>, et <i>illum ego per flammas eripui</i>
ut aliquid illic soni etiam consonantis ammiscere videantur, quod
pinguissimae prolationis est. Romana lingua emendationem habet in hoc
quoque distinctione. Nam alicubi pinguius, alicubi debet exilius,
proferri: pinguius cum vel <b>b</b> sequitur, ut in <i>albo</i>; vel
<b>c</b>, ut in <i>pulchro</i>; vel <b>f</b>, ut in <i>adelfis</i>; vel
<b>g</b>, ut in <i>alga</i>; vel <b>m</b>, ut in <i>pulmone</i>; vel
<b>p</b>, ut in <i>scalpro</i>: exilius autem proferenda est ubicumque
ab ea verbum incipit; ut in <i>lepore</i>, <i>lana</i>, <i>lupo</i>; vel
ubi in eodem verbo et prior syllaba in hac finitur, et sequens ab ea
incipit, ut <i>ille</i> et <i>Allia</i>.
</blockquote>

<p>In another place he speaks of the Africans as ‘abounding’ in this
vice, and of their pronouncing <i>Metellus</i> and <i>Catullus</i>;
<i>Metelus</i>, <i>Catulus</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;V. p.&nbsp;287.</small>] In his etiam agnoscimus
gentium vitia; <i>labdacismis</i> scatent Afri, raro est ut aliquis
dicat <b>l</b>: per geminum <b>l</b> sic loquuntur Romani, omnes Latini
sic loquuntur, <i>Catullus</i>, <i>Metellus</i>.
</blockquote>

<p><b>M</b> is pronounced as in English, except before <b>q</b>, where
it has a nasal sound, and when final.</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Mar. Vict. Keil. v.&nbsp;VI. p.&nbsp;32.</small>] <b>M</b>
impressis invicem labiis mugitum quendam intra oris specum attractis
naribus dabit.
</blockquote>

<p>But this ‘mooing’ sound, in which so many of their words ended, was
not altogether pleasing to the Roman ear. Quintilian exclaims
against&nbsp;it:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Quint. XII. x. 31.</small>] Quid quod pleraque nos illa quasi
mugiente littera cludimus <b>m</b>, qua nullum Graece verbum cadit.
</blockquote>

<p>
<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
The offensive sound was therefore gotten rid of, as far as possible, by
obscuring the <b>m</b> at the end of a word. Priscian speaks of three
sounds of <b>m</b>,&mdash;at the beginning, in the middle, and at the
end of a word:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Prisc. Keil. v.&nbsp;II. p.&nbsp;29.</small>] <b>M</b> obscurum
in extremitate dictionum sonat, ut <i>templum</i>, apertum in principio,
ut <i>magnus</i>; mediocre in mediis, ut <i>umbra</i>.
</blockquote>

<p>This ‘obscuring’ led in verse to the cutting off of the final
syllable in <b>m</b> when the following word began with a
vowel,&mdash;as Priscian remarks in the same connection:</p>

<blockquote>
Finales dictionis subtrahitur <b>m</b> in metro plerumque, si a vocali
incipit sequens dictio, ut:
</blockquote>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Illum expirantem transfixo pectore flammas.”</p>
</div>

<p>Yet, he adds, the ancients did not always withdraw the sound:</p>

<blockquote>
Vetustissimi tamen non semper eam subtrahebant, Ennius in X Annalium:
</blockquote>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Insigneita fere tum milia militum octo</p>
<p>&nbsp;Duxit delectos bellum tolerare potentes.”</p>
</div>

<p>The <b>m</b> was not, however, entirely ignored. Thus Quintilian
says:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Quint. IX. iv. 40.</small>] Atqui eadem illa littera, quotiens
ultima est et vocalem verbi sequentis ita contingit ut in eam transire
possit, etiamsi scribitur tamen parum exprimitur, ut <i>multum ille</i>
et <i>quantum erat</i>; adeo ut paene cujusdam novae litterae sonum
reddat. Neque enim eximitur, sed obscuratur, et tantum aliqua inter duas
vocales velut nota est, ne ipsae coeant.
</blockquote>

<p>It is a significant fact in this connection that <b>m</b> is the only
one of the liquids (semivowels) that does not allow a long vowel before
it. Priscian, mentioning several peculiarities of this semivowel, thus
speaks of this one:</p>

<blockquote>
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
[<small>Priscian. Keil. v.&nbsp;II. p.&nbsp;23.</small>] Nunquam tamen
eadem <b>m</b> ante se natura longam (vocalem) patitur in eadem syllaba
esse, ut <i>illam</i>, <i>artem</i>, <i>puppim</i>, <i>illum</i>,
<i>rem</i>, <i>spem</i>, <i>diem</i>, cum aliae omnes semivocales hoc
habent, ut <i>Maecenas</i>, <i>Paean</i>, <i>sol</i>, <i>pax</i>,
<i>par</i>.
</blockquote>

<p>That the <b>m</b> was really sounded we may infer from Pompeius
(on&nbsp;Donatus) where, treating of <i>myotacism</i>, he calls it the
careless pronunciation of <b>m</b> between two vowels (at&nbsp;the end
of one word and the beginning of another), the running of the words
together in such a way that <b>m</b> seems to begin the second, rather
than to end the first:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;V. p.&nbsp;287.</small>] Ut si dices <i>hominem
amicum</i>, <i>oratorem optimum</i>. Non enim videris dicere <i>hominem
amicum</i>, sed <i>homine mamicum</i>, quod est incongruum et
inconsonans. Similiter <i>oratorem optimum</i> videris <i>oratore
moptimum</i>.
</blockquote>

<p>He also warns against the vice of dropping the <b>m</b> altogether.
One must neither say <i>homine mamicum</i>, nor <i>homine
amicum</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
Plerumque enim aut suspensione pronuntiatur aut exclusione.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Nos quid sequi debemus? Quid? per suspensionem tantum
modo. Qua ratione? Quia si dixeris per suspensionem <i>homimem
amicum</i>, et haec vitium vitabis, <i>myotacismum</i>, et non cades in
aliud vitium, id est in hiatum.
</blockquote>

<p>From such passages it would seem that the final syllable ending in
<b>m</b> is to be lightly and rapidly pronounced, the <b>m</b> not to be
run over upon the following word.</p>

<p>Some hint of the sound may perhaps be got from the Englishman’s
pronunciation of such words as Birmingham (Birminghm), Sydenham
(Sydenhm), Blenheim (Blenhm).</p>

<p><b>N</b>, except when followed by <b>f</b> or <b>s</b>, is pronounced
as in English, only that it is more dental.</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Mar. Vict. Keil. v.&nbsp;VI. p.&nbsp;32.</small>] <b>N</b> vero,
sub convexo palati lingua inhaerente, gemino naris et oris spiritu
explicabitur.
</blockquote>

<p>
<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
Naturally, as with us, it is more emphatic at the beginning and end of
words than in the middle (as, <i>Do not give the tendrils the wrong
turn. Is not the sin condemned?</i>)</p>

<p>Priscian says:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;II. p.&nbsp;29.</small>] <b>N</b> quoque plenior
in primis sonat, et in ultimis, partibus syllabarum, ut <i>nomen</i>,
<i>stamen</i>; exilior in mediis, ut <i>amnis</i>, <i>damnum</i>.
</blockquote>

<p>As in English, before a guttural (<b>c</b>, <b>g</b>, <b>q</b>,
<b>x</b>), <b>n</b> is so affected as to leave its proper sound
incomplete (the tongue not touching the roof of the mouth) while it
draws the guttural, so to speak, into itself, as in the English words
<i>concord</i>, <i>anger</i>, <i>sinker</i>, <i>relinquish</i>,
<i>anxious</i>.</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Nigidius apud Gell. XIX. xiv. 7.</small>] Inter litteram
<b>n</b> et <b>g</b> est alia vis, ut in nomine <i>anguis</i> et
<i>angaria</i> et <i>anchorae</i> et <i>increpat</i> et <i>incurrit</i>
et <i>ingenuus</i>. In omnibus enim his non verum <b>n</b> sed
adulterinum ponitur. Nam <i>n</i> non esse lingua indicio est. Nam si ea
littera esset lingua palatum tangeret.
</blockquote>

<p>Not only the Greeks, but some of the early Romans, wrote <b>g</b>,
instead of <b>n</b>, in this position, and gave to the letter so used a
new name, <i>agma</i>. Priscian says:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;II. p.&nbsp;29.</small>] Sequente <b>g</b> vel
<b>c</b>, pro ea (<b>n</b>) <b>g</b> scribunt Graeci et quidam tamen
vetustissimi auctores Romani euphoniae causa bene hoc facientes, ut
<i>Agchises</i>, <i>agceps</i>, <i>aggulus</i>, <i>aggens</i>, quod
ostendit Varro in <i>Primo de Origine Linguae Latinae</i> his verbis: Ut
Ion scribit, quinquavicesima est littera, quam vocant “<i>agma</i>,”
cujus forma nulla est et vox communis est Graecis et Latinis, ut his
verbis: <i>aggulus</i>, <i>aggens</i>, <i>agguilla</i>, <i>iggerunt</i>.
In ejusmodi Graeci et Accius noster bina <b>g</b> scribunt, alii
<b>n</b> et <b>g</b>, quod in hoc veritatem videre facile non est.
</blockquote>

<p>This custom did not, however, prevail among the Romans, and Marius
Victorinus gives it as his opinion that it is
<span class = "pagenum">25</span>
better to use <b>n</b> than <b>g</b>, as more correct to the ear, and
avoiding ambiguity (the <b>gg</b> being then left for the natural
expression of double <b>g</b>).</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Mar. Vict. I. iii. 70.</small>] Familiarior est auribus nostris
<b>n</b> potius quam <b>g</b>, ut <i>anceps</i> et <i>ancilla</i> et
<i>anguia</i> et <i>angustum</i> et <i>anquirit</i> et <i>ancora</i>, et
similia, per <b>n</b> potius quam per <b>g</b> scribite: sicut per duo
<b>g</b> quotiens duorum <b>g</b> sonum aures exigent, ut
<i>aggerem</i>, <i>suggillat</i>, <i>suggerendum</i>, <i>suggestum</i>,
et similia.
</blockquote>

<p><b>N</b> before <b>f</b> or <b>s</b> seems to have become a mere
nasal, lengthening the preceding vowel.</p>

<p>Cicero speaks of this as justified by the ear and by custom, rather
than by reason:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Cic. Or. XLVIII.</small>] Quid vero hoc elegantius, quod non fit
natura, sed quodam institute? <i>indoctus</i> dicimus brevi prima
littera, <i>insanis</i> producta: <i>inhumanus</i> brevi, <i>infelix</i>
longa: et, ne multis, quibus in verbis eae primae litterae sunt quae in
<i>sapiente</i> atque <i>felice</i>, producte dicitur; in ceteris
omnibus breviter: itemque <i>composuit</i>, <i>consuevit</i>,
<i>concrepit</i>, <i>confecit</i>. Consule veritatem, reprehendet; refer
ad aures, probabunt. Quaere, cur? Ita se dicent juvari. Voluptati autem
aurium morigerari debet oratio.
</blockquote>

<p>In Donatus we have the same fact stated, with the same reason:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;IV. p.&nbsp;442.</small>] Quod magis aurium
indicio quam artis ratione colligimus.
</blockquote>

<p>Thus we find numeral adverbs and others ending either in <i>iens</i>
or <i>ies</i>, as <i>centiens</i> or <i>centies</i>, <i>decies</i> or
<i>deciens</i>, <i>millies</i> or <i>milliens</i>, <i>quotiens</i> or
<i>quoties</i>, <i>totiens</i> or <i>toties</i>. Other words, in like
manner, participles and nouns, are written either with or without the
<b>n</b> before <b>s</b>, as <i>contunsum</i> or <i>contusum</i>,
<i>obtunsus</i> or <i>obtusus</i>, <i>thesaurus</i> or <i>thensaurus</i>
(the <i>ens</i> is regularly represented in Greek by <span class =
"greek" lang = "el" title = "ês">ης</span>); <i>infans</i> or
<i>infas</i>, <i>frons</i> or <i>fros</i>. In late Latin the <b>n</b>
was frequently dropped in participle endings.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">26</span>
<p>Donatus says that this nasal sound of <b>n</b> should be strenuously
observed:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;IV. p.&nbsp;442.</small>] Illud vehementissime
observare debemus, ut <i>con</i> et <i>in</i> quotiensque post se habent
<b>s</b> vel <b>f</b> litteram, videamus quemadmodum pronuntientur.
Plerumque enim non observantes in barbarismos incurrimus.
</blockquote>

<p><b>Gn</b> in the terminations <i>gnus</i>, <i>gna</i>, <i>gnum</i>,
has, according to Priscian, the power to lengthen the penultimate
vowel.</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Prisc. I.</small>] <i>Gnus</i> quoque, vel <i>gna</i>, vel
<i>gnum</i>, terminantia, longam habent vocalem penultimam; ut a
<i>regno</i>, <i>regnum</i>; a <i>sto</i>, <i>stagnum</i>; a
<i>bene</i>, <i>benignus</i>; a <i>male</i>, <i>malignus</i>; ab
<i>abiete</i>, <i>abiegnus</i>; <i>privignus</i>; <i>Pelignus</i>.
</blockquote>

<p>(Perhaps the liquid sound, as in <i>cañon</i>.)</p>

<p><b>P</b> is pronounced as in English.</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Mar. Vict. Keil. v.&nbsp;VI. p.&nbsp;32.</small>] <b>E</b>
quibus <b>b</b> et <b>p</b> litterae .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dispari inter se
oris officio exprimuntur. Nam prima exploso e mediis labiis sono;
sequens, compresso ore, velut introrsum attracto vocis ictu, explicatur.
</blockquote>

<p><b>Q</b> has the sound of English <b>q</b> in the words <i>quire</i>,
<i>quick</i>.</p>

<p>Priscian says:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;II. p.&nbsp;12.</small>] <b>K</b> enim et
<b>q</b>, quamvis figura et nomine videantur aliquam habere
differentiam, cum <b>c</b> tamen eandem, tam in sono vocum, quam in
metro, potestatem continent.
</blockquote>

<p>And again:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Id. ib. p.&nbsp;36.</small>] De <b>q</b> quoque sufficienter
supra tractatum est, quae nisi eandem vim haberet quam&nbsp;<b>c</b>.
</blockquote>

<p>Marius Victorinus says:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;VI. p.&nbsp;5.</small>] Item superfluas quasdam
videntur retinere, <b>x</b> et <b>k</b> et <b>q</b> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Pro
<b>k</b> et <b>q</b>, <b>c</b> littera facillime haberetur; <b>x</b>
autem per <b>c</b> et&nbsp;<b>s</b>.
</blockquote>

<p>
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
And again:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Id. ib. p.&nbsp;32.</small>] <b>K</b> et <b>q</b> supervacue
numero litterarum inseri doctorum plerique contendunt, scilicet quod
<b>c</b> littera harum officium possit implere.
</blockquote>

<p>The grammarians tell us that <b>k</b> and <b>q</b> are always found
at the beginning of a syllable:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Prise. Keil. v.&nbsp;III. p.&nbsp;111.</small>] <b>Q</b> et
<b>k</b> semper initio syllabarum ponuntur.
</blockquote>

<p>They say also that the use of <b>q</b> was more free among the
earlier Romans, who placed it as initial wherever <b>u</b>
followed,&mdash;as they placed <b>k</b> wherever <b>ă</b>
followed,&mdash;but that in the later, established, usage, its presence
was conditioned upon a vowel after the <b>u</b> in the same
syllable:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Donat. Keil. v.&nbsp;IV. p.&nbsp;442.</small>] Namque illi
<b>q</b> praeponebant quotiens <b>u</b> sequebatur, ut <i>quum</i>; nos
vero non possumus <b>q</b> praeponere nisi ut <b>u</b> sequatur et post
ipsam alia vocalis, ut <i>quoniam</i>.
</blockquote>

<p>Diomedes says:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;I. p.&nbsp;425.</small>] <b>Q</b> consonans muta,
ex <b>c</b> et <b>u</b> litteris composita, supervacua, qua utimur
quando <b>u</b> et altera vocalis in una syllaba junguntur, ut
<i>Quirinus</i>.
</blockquote>

<p><b>R</b> is trilled, as in Italian or French:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Mar. Vict. Keil. v.&nbsp;VI. p.&nbsp;32.</small>] Sequetur
<b>r</b>, quae, vibratione vocis in palato linguae fastigio, fragorem
tremulis ictibus reddit.
</blockquote>

(This proper trilling of the <b>r</b> is most important.)

<p><b>S</b> seems to have had, almost, if not quite, invariably the
sharp sound of the English <b>s</b> in <i>sing</i>, <i>hiss</i>.</p>

<p>In Greek words written also with <b>z</b>, as <i>Smyrna</i> (also
written <i>Zmyrna</i>), it probably had the <b>z</b> sound, and possibly
in a few Latin words, as <i>rosa</i>, <i>miser</i>, but this is not
certain.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">28</span>
<p>Marius Victorinus thus sets forth the difference between <b>s</b> and
<b>x</b>&nbsp;(cs):</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;VI. p.&nbsp;32.</small>] Dehinc duae supremae,
<b>s</b> et <b>x</b>, jure junguntur. Nam vicino inter se sonore
attracto sibilant rictu, ita tamen si prioris ictus pone dentes
excitatus ad medium lenis agitetur, sequentis autem crasso spiritu
hispidum sonet, quia per conjunctionem <b>c</b> et <b>s</b>, quarum et
locum implet et vim exprimit, ut sensu aurium ducemur, efficitur.
</blockquote>

<p>Donatus, according to Pompeius, complains of the Greeks as sounding
the <b>s</b> too feebly:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;V. p.&nbsp;394.</small>] Item <b>s</b> litteram
Graeci exiliter ecferunt adeo ut cum dicunt <i>jussit</i> per unum
<b>s</b> dicere existimas.
</blockquote>

<p>This would indicate that the Romans pronounced the sibilant
distinctly,&mdash;yet not too emphatically, for Quintilian says, ‘the
master of his art (of&nbsp;speaking) will not fondly prolong or dally
with his <b>s</b>’:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Quint. I. xi. 6.</small>] Ne illas quidem circa <b>s</b>
litteram delicias hic magister feret.
</blockquote>

<p><b>T</b> is pronounced like the English <b>t</b> pure, except that
the tongue should approach the teeth more nearly.</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Pompei. <i>Comm. ad Donat.</i> Keil. v.&nbsp;VI.
p.&nbsp;32.</small>] <b>D</b> autem et <b>t</b>, quibus, ut ita dixerim,
vocis vicinitas quaedam est, linguae sublatione ac positione
distinguuntur. Nam cum summos atque imos conjunctim dentes suprema sua
parte pulsaverit <b>d</b> litteram exprimit. Quotiens autem sublimata
partem qua superis dentibus est <i>origo</i> contigerit, <b>t</b> sonore
vocis explicabit.
</blockquote>

<p>From the same writer we learn that some pronounced the <b>t</b> too
heavily, giving it a ‘thick sound’:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;V. p.&nbsp;394.</small>] Ecce in littera <b>t</b>
aliqui ita pingue nescio quid sonant, ut cum dicunt <i>etiam</i> nihil
de media syllaba infringant.
</blockquote>

<p>
<span class = "pagenum">29</span>
By which we understand that the <b>t</b> was wrongly uttered with a kind
of effort, such as prevented its gliding on to the&nbsp;<b>i</b>.</p>

<p><b>Th</b> nearly as in <i>then</i>, not as in <i>thin</i>.</p>

<p><b>U</b> (consonant) or <b>V</b>.</p>

<p>That the letter <b>u</b> performed the office of both vowel and
consonant all the grammarians agree, and state the fact in nearly the
same terms. Priscian says that they (<b>i</b> and <b>u</b>) seem quite
other letters when used as consonants, and that it makes a great
difference in which of these ways they are used:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;II. p.&nbsp;13.</small>] Videntur tamen <b>i</b>
et <b>u</b> cum in consonantes transeunt quantum ad potestatem, quod
maximum est in elementis, aliae litterae esse praeter supra dictis;
multum enim interest utrum vocales sint an consonantes.
</blockquote>

<p>The grammarians also state that this consonant <b>u</b> was
represented by the Greek digamma, which the Romans called <i>vau</i>
also.</p>

<p>Marius Victorinus says:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>I. iii. 44.</small>] Nam littera <b>u</b> vocalis est, sicut
<b>a</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>o</b>, sed eadem vicem obtinet
consonantis: cujus potestatis notam Graeci habent <span class = "greek"
lang = "el" title = "Greek letter digamma">ϝ</span>, nostri <i>vau</i>
vocant, et alii <i>digamma</i>; ea per se scripta non facit syllabam,
anteposita autem vocali facit, ut <span class = "greek" lang = "el"
title = "wamaxa, wekêbolos">ϝάμαξα, ϝεκήβολος</span> et <span class =
"greek" lang = "el" title = "welenê">ϝελήνη</span>. Nos vero, qui non
habemus hujus vocis nomen aut notam, in ejus locum quotiens una vocalis
pluresve junctae unam syllabam faciunt, substituimus <b>u</b> litteram.
</blockquote>

<p>Now it is contended by some that this <i>digamma</i>, or <i>vau</i>,
was merely taken as a symbol, somewhat arbitrarily perhaps, and that it
did not indicate a particular sound, but might stand for anything which
the Romans chose to represent by it; and that therefore it gives us no
certain indication of what the Latin <b>u</b> consonant was.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
<p>But we are expressly told that it had the force and sound of the
Greek <i>digamma</i>.</p>

<p>In Marius Victorinus we find:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;VI. p.&nbsp;23.</small>] <ins class = "correction"
title = "printed as capital F, not digamma">F</ins> autem apud Aeolis

"bau">βαυ</span> et <i>digamma</i>.
</blockquote>

<p>Priscian explains more fully:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v. II. p. 15.</small>] <b>U</b> vero loco consonantis
posita eandem prorsus in omnibus vim habuit apud Latinos quam apud
Aeolis <i>digamma</i>. Unde a plerisque ei nomen hoc datur quod apud

<i>digamma</i>, id est <i>vau</i>, ab ipsius voce profectum teste
Varrone et Didymo, qui id ei nomen esse ostendunt. Pro quo Caesar hanc
<ins class = "correction greek" lang = "el" title = "upside-down digamma">[ϝ]</ins>

est tamen consuetudo antiqua superavit. Adeo autem hoc verum est quod
pro Aeolico <i>digamma</i> <span class = "greek" lang = "el">ϝ</span>
<b>u</b> ponitur.
</blockquote>

<p>What then was the sound of this Aeolic <i>digamma</i> or <span class
= "greek" lang = "el" title = "bau">βαυ</span>?</p>

<p>Priscian says:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;II. p.&nbsp;11.</small>] <span class = "greek"
lang = "el">ϝ</span> Aeolicum <i>digamma</i>, quod apud antiquissimos

veteres Graecos pro <span class = "greek" lang = "el" title =
"Greek letters phi, pi">φ π</span> et <span class = "greek" lang = "el" title =
"archaic Greek letter Heta">Ͱ</span>; unde nunc quoque in Graecis

ut <i>Orpheus</i>, <i>Phaethon</i>. Postea vero in Latinis verbis
placuit pro p et&nbsp;h, f&nbsp;scribi, ut fama, filius, facio, loco
autem <i>digamma</i> <b>u</b> pro consonante, quod cognatione soni
videbatur affinis esse <i>digamma</i> ea littera.
</blockquote>

<p>The Latin <b>u</b> consonant is here distinctly stated to be akin to
the Greek <i>digamma</i> (<span class = "greek" lang = "el" title =
"Greek letter digamma">ϝ</span>) in sound.</p>

<p>Now the office of the Greek <i>digamma</i> was apparently manifold.
It stood for <span class = "greek" lang = "el"
title = "Greek letters sigma, beta">ς, β</span>
(Eng. <b>v</b>), <span class = "greek" lang =
"el" title = "Greek letters gamma, chi, phi">γ, χ, φ</span>, and for the
breathings ‘rough’ and ‘smooth.’ Sometimes the sound of the
<i>digamma</i> is given, we are told, where the character itself
<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
is not written. It is said that in the neighborhood of Olympia it is
to-day pronounced, though not written, between two vowels as <span class
= "greek" lang = "el" title = "Greek letter beta">β</span> (Eng.
<b>v</b>). Which of these various sounds should be given the digamma
appears to have been determined by the law of euphony. It was sometimes
written but not sounded (like our <b>h</b>).</p>

<p>The question then is, which of these various sounds of the digamma is
represented by the Latin <b>u</b> consonant, or does it represent all,
or none, of these.</p>

<p>Speaking of <b>f</b>, Priscian says:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;II. p.&nbsp;35.</small>] Antiqui Romanorum Aeolis
sequentes loco aspirationis eam (<b>f</b>) ponebant, effugientes ipsi
quoque aspirationem, et maxime cum consonante recusabant eam proferre in
Latino sermone. Habebat autem haec <b>f</b> littera hunc sonum quem nunc
habet <b>u</b> loco consonantis posita, unde antiqui <b>af</b> pro
<b>ab</b> scribere solebant; sed quia non potest <i>vau</i>, id est
<i>digamma</i>, in fine syllabae inveniri, ideo mutata in&nbsp;<b>b</b>.
<i>Sifilum</i> quoque pro <i>sibilum</i> teste Nonio Marcello <i>de
Doctorum Indagine</i> dicebant.
</blockquote>

<p>And again:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Prisc. Keil. v.&nbsp;II. p.&nbsp;15.</small>] In <b>b</b> etiam
solet apud Aeolis transire <span class = "greek" lang = "el" title =
"Greek letter digamma">ϝ</span> <i>digamma</i> quotiens ab <span class =
"greek" lang = "el" title = "Greek letter rho">ρ</span> incipit dictio
quae solet aspirari, ut <span class = "greek" lang = "el" title =
"rhêtôr, brêtôr">ῥήτωρ, βρήτωρ</span> dicunt, quod <i>digamma</i> nisi
vocali praeponi et in principio syllabae non potest. Ideo autem locum
transmutavit, quia <b>b</b> vel <i>digamma</i> post <span class =
"greek" lang = "el" title = "Greek letter rho">ρ</span> in eadem syllaba
pronuntiari non potest. Apud nos quoque est invenire quod pro <b>u</b>
consonante <b>b</b> ponitur, ut <i>caelebs</i>, caelestium vitam ducens,
per <b>b</b> scribitur, quod <b>u</b> consonans ante consonantem poni
non potest. Sed etiam <i>Bruges</i> et <i>Belena</i> antiquissimi
dicebant, teste Quintiliano, qui hoc ostendit in primo <i>institutionum
oratoriarum</i>: nec mirum, cum <b>b</b> quoque in <b>u</b> euphoniae
causa converti invenimus; ut <i>aufero</i>.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
[<small>Quint. I. v. 69.</small>] Frequenter autem praepositiones quoque
copulatio ista corrumpit; inde <i>abstulit</i>, <i>aufugit</i>,
<i>amisit</i>, cum praepositio sit <b>ab</b> sola.
</blockquote>

<p>
<span class = "pagenum">32</span>
It is significant here that Cicero speaks of the change from <b>du</b>
to <b>b</b> as a contraction. He says:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Cic. Or. LXV.</small>] Quid vero licentius quam quod hominum
etiam nomina contrahebant, quo essent aptiora? Nam ut <i>duellum</i>,
<i>bellum</i>; et <i>duis</i>, <i>bis</i>; sic <i>Duellium</i> eum qui
Poenos classe devicit <i>Bellium</i> nominaverunt, cum superiores
appellati essent semper <i>Duellii</i>.
</blockquote>

<p>One cannot but feel in reading the numerous passages in the
grammarians that treat of the sound of <b>u</b> consonant, that if its
sound had been no other than the natural sound of <b>u</b> with
consonantal force, they never would have spent so much time and labor in
explaining and elucidating it. Why did they not turn it off with the
simple explanation which they give to the consonantal
<b>i</b>&mdash;that of double <b>i</b>? What more natural than to speak
of consonant <b>u</b> as “double <b>u</b>” (as&nbsp;we English do
<b>w</b>). But on the contrary they expressly declare it to have a sound
distinct and peculiar. Quintilian says that even if the form of the
Aeolic <i>digamma</i> is rejected by the Romans, yet its force pursues
them:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Quint. XII. x. 29.</small>] Aeolicae quoque litterae qua
<i>servum cervum</i>que dicimus, etiamsi forma a nobis repudiata est,
vis tamen nos ipsa persequitur.
</blockquote>

<p>He gives it as his opinion that it would have been well to have
adopted the <i>vau</i>, and says that neither by the old way of writing
(by&nbsp;<b>uo</b>), nor by the modern way (by&nbsp;<b>uu</b>), is at
all produced the sound which we perceive:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Quint. I. vii. 26.</small>] Nunc <b>u</b> gemina scribuntur
(<i>servus</i> et <i>cervus</i>) ea ratione quam reddidi: neutro sane
modo vox quam sentimus efficitur. Nec inutiliter Claudius Aeolicam illam
ad hos usus litteram adjecerat.
</blockquote>

<p>
<span class = "pagenum">33</span>
And again still more distinctly:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Id. ib. iv. 7, 8.</small>] At grammatici saltem omnes in hanc
descendent rerum tenuitatem, desintne aliquae nobis necessariae
literarum, non cum Graeca scribimus (tum enim ab iisdem duas mutuamur)
sed propriae, in Latinis, ut in his <i>seruus</i> et <i>uulgus</i>
Aeolicum digammon desideratur.
</blockquote>

<p>This need of a new symbol, recognized by authorities like Cicero and
Quintilian, is not an insignificant point in the argument.</p>

<p>Marius Victorinus says that Cicero adds <b>u</b> (consonant) to the
other five consonants that are understood to assimilate certain other
consonants coming before them:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Mar. Vict. I. iv. 64.</small>] Sed propriae sunt cognatae
(consonantes) quae simili figuratione oris dicuntur, ut est <b>b</b>,
<b>f</b>, <b>r</b>, <b>m</b>, <b>p</b>, quibus Cicero adjicit <b>u</b>,
non eam quae accipitur pro vocali, sed eam quae consonantis obtinet
vicem, et interposita vocali fit ut aliae quoque consonantes.
</blockquote>

<p>He proceeds to illustrate with the proposition <b>ob</b>:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Id. ib. 67.</small>] <b>Ob</b> autem mutatur in cognatas easdem,
ut <i>offert</i>, <i>officit</i>; et <i>ommovet</i>, <i>ommutescit</i>;
et <i>oppandit</i>, <i>opperitur</i>; <i>ovvertit</i>, <i>ovvius</i>.
</blockquote>

<p>Let any one, keeping in mind the distinctness with which the Romans
uttered doubled consonants, attempt to pronounce <i>ovvius</i> on the
theory of consonant <b>u</b> like English (<b>w</b>)&nbsp;(!).</p>

<p>By the advocates of the <b>w</b> sound of the <b>v</b> much stress is
laid upon the fact that the poets occasionally change the consonant into
the vowel <b>u</b>, and <i>vice versa</i>; as Horace, Epode
VIII.&nbsp;2:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Nivesque deducunt Jovem, nunc mare nunc siluæ̈;”</p>
</div>

<p>
<span class = "pagenum">34</span>
Or Lucretius, in II. 232:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Propterea quia corpus aquae naturaque tenvis.”</p>
</div>

<p>Such single instances suggest, indeed, a common origin in the
<b>u</b> and <b>v</b>, and a poet’s license, archaistic perhaps; but no
more determine the ordinary value of the letter than, say, in the
English poets the rhyming of wĭnd with mīnd, or the making a distinct
syllable of the <i>ed</i> in participle endings.</p>

<p>Another argument used in support of the <b>w</b> sound is taken from
the words of Nigidius Figulus.</p>

<p>He was contending, we are told, that words and names come into being
not by chance, or arbitrarily, but by nature; and he takes, among other
examples, the words <i>vos</i> and <i>nos</i>, <i>tu</i> and <i>ego</i>,
<i>tibi</i> and <i>mihi</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Aul. Gell. X. iv. 4.</small>] <i>Vos</i>, inquit, cum dicimus
motu quodam oris conveniente cum ipsius verbi demonstratione utimur, et
labias sensim primores emovemus, ac spiritum atque animam porro versum
et ad eos quibuscum sermonicamur intendimus. At contra cum dicimus
<i>nos</i> neque profuso intentoque flatu vocis, neque projectis labiis
pronunciamus; sed et spiritum et labias quasi intra nosmetipsos
coercemus. Hoc idem fit et in eo quod dicimus <i>tu</i> et <i>ego</i>;
et <i>tibi</i> et <i>mihi</i>. Nam sicuti cum adnuimus et abnuimus,
motus quidem ille vel capitis vel oculorum a natura rei quam
significabat non abhorret; ita in his vocibus, quasi gestus quidam oris
et spiritus naturalis est.
</blockquote>

<p>But a little careful examination will show that this passage favors
the other side rather.</p>

<p>The first part of the description: “labias sensim primores emovemus,”
will apply to either sound, <i>vos</i> or <i>wos</i>, although better,
as will appear upon consulting the mirror, to <i>vos</i> than to
<i>wos</i>; but the second: “ac spiritum atque animam porro versum et ad
eos quibuscum sermonicamur intendimus,”
<span class = "pagenum">35</span>
will certainly apply far better to <i>vos</i> than to <i>wos</i>. In
<i>wos</i> we get the “projectis labiis” to some extent, although not so
marked as in <i>vos</i>; but we do not get anything like the same
“profuso intentoque flatu vocis” as in <i>vos</i>.</p>

<p>The same may be said of the argument drawn from the anecdote related
by Cicero in his <i>de Divinatione</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Cic. de Div. XL. 84.</small>] Cum M. Crassus exercitum Brundisii
imponeret, quidam in portu caricas Cauno advectas vendens “Cauneas!”
clamitabat. Dicamus, si placet, monitum ab eo Crassum <i>caveret ne
iret</i>, non fuisse periturum si omini paruisset.
</blockquote>

<p>Now when we remember that Caunos, whence these particular figs came,
was a Greek town; that the fig-seller was very likely a Greek himself
(Brundisium being a Greek port so to speak), but at any rate probably
pronounced the name as it was doubtless always heard; and that <b>u</b>
in such a connection is at present pronounced like our <b>f</b> or
<b>v</b>, and we know of no time when it was pronounced like our
<b>u</b>, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the fig-seller
was crying “Cafneas!”&mdash;a sound far more suggestive of
<i>Cave-ne-eas!</i> than “<i>Cauneas!</i>” of <i>Cawe ne eas!</i></p>

<p>But beyond the testimony, direct and indirect, of grammarians and
classic writers, an argument against the <b>w</b> sound appears in the
fact that this sound is not found in Greek (from which the <i>vau</i> is
borrowed), nor in Italian or kindred Romance languages.</p>

<p>The initial <b>u</b> in Italian represents not Latin <b>u</b>
consonant, but some other letter, as <b>h</b>, in <i>uomo</i> (for
<i>homo</i>). On the other hand we find the <b>v</b> sound, as
<i>vedova</i> (from <i>vidua</i>),&mdash;notice the two <b>v</b>
sounds,&mdash;or the <b>u</b> sometimes changed to <b>b</b>, as
<i>serbare</i> from <i>servare</i>; <i>bibita</i> and <i>bevanda</i>,
both from <i>bibo</i>.</p>

<p>In French we find the Latin <b>u</b> consonant passing into <b>f</b>,
as <i>ovum</i> into <i>œuf</i>; <i>novem</i> into <i>neuf</i>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
<p>It seems not improbable that in Cicero’s time and later the consonant
<b>u</b> represented some variation of sound, that its value varied in
the direction of <b>b</b> or <b>f</b>, and possibly, in some Greek words
especially, it was more vocalized, as in <i>vae!</i> (Greek <span class
= "greek" lang = "el" title = "ouai">ουάι</span>). Yet here it is worthy
of note that the corresponding words in Italian are not written with
<b>u</b> but with <i>gu</i>, as <i>guai!</i></p>

<p>In considering the sound of Latin <i>u</i> consonant we must always
keep in mind that the question is one of time,&mdash;not, was <i>u</i>
ever pronounced as English <i>w</i>; but, was it so pronounced in the
time of Cicero and Virgil. Professor Ellis well says: “Any one who
wishes to arrive at a conclusion respecting the Latin consonantal u must
learn to pronounce and distinguish readily the four series of sounds:
<b>ŭa ŭe ŭi ŭo</b>, <b>wa we wi wo wu</b>, <b>v’a v’e v’i v’o v’u</b>,
<b>va ve vi vo vu</b>.”</p>

<p>Now the question is: At what point along this line do we find the
<b>u</b> consonant of the golden age? Roby, though not agreeing with
Ellis in rejecting the English <b>w</b> sound, as the representative of
that period, declares himself “quite content to think that a labial
<b>v</b> was provincially contemporary and in the end generally
superseded it.”</p>

<p>But ‘provincialisms’ do not seem sufficient to account for the use of
<span class = "greek" lang = "el" title = "Greek letter beta">β</span>
for <b>u</b> consonant in inscriptions and in writers of the first
century. For instance, <i>Nerva</i> and <i>Severus</i> in contemporary
inscriptions are written both with <span class = "greek" lang = "el"
title = "ou">ου</span> and with <span class = "greek" lang = "el" title
= "Greek letter beta">β</span>: <span class = "greek" lang = "el" title
= "Neroua, Nerba">Νέρουα, Νέρβα</span>; <span class = "greek" lang =
"el" title = "Seouêros, Sebêros">Σεουῆρος, Σεβῆρος</span>. And in
Plutarch we find numerous instances of <span class = "greek" lang = "el"
title = "Greek letter beta">β</span> taking the place of <span class =
"greek" lang = "el" title = "ou">ου</span>.</p>

<p>It is true that the instances in which we find <span class = "greek"
lang = "el" title = "Greek letter beta">β</span> taking the place of
<span class = "greek" lang = "el" title = "ou">ου</span> in the first
century, and earlier, are decidedly in the minority, but when we
recollect that <span class = "greek" lang = "el" title = "ou">ου</span>
was the original and natural representative of the Latin <b>u</b>, the
fact that a
<span class = "pagenum">37</span>
change was made at all is of great weight, and one instance of <span
class = "greek" lang = "el" title = "Greek letter beta">β</span> for
<b>u</b> would outweigh a dozen instances of the old
form,&nbsp;<b>ou</b>. That the letter should be changed in the Greek,
even when it had not been in the Latin, seems to make it certain that
the ‘Greek ear,’ at least, had detected a real variation of sound from
the original <b>u</b>, and one that approached, at least, their <span
class = "greek" lang = "el" title = "Greek letter beta">β</span> (Eng.
<b>v</b>).</p>

<p>Nor, in this connection, should we fail to notice the words in Latin
where <b>u</b> consonant is represented by <b>b</b>, such as
<i>bubile</i> from <i>bovile</i>, <i>defervi</i> and <i>deferbui</i>
from <i>deferveo</i>.</p>

<p>In concluding the argument for the labial <b>v</b> sound of
consonantal <b>u</b>, it may be proper to suggest a fact which should
have no weight against a conclusive argument on the other side, but
which might, perhaps, be allowed to turn the scale nicely balanced. The
<b>w</b> sound is not only unfamiliar but nearly, if not quite,
impossible, to the lips of any European people except the English, and
would therefore of necessity have to be left out of any universally
adopted scheme of Latin pronunciation. Professor Ellis pertinently says:
“As a matter of practical convenience English speakers should abstain
from <b>w</b> in Latin, because no Continental nation can adopt a sound
they cannot pronounce.”</p>

<p><b>X</b> has the same sound as in English.</p>

<p>Marius Victorinus says:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. t. VI. p.&nbsp;32.</small>] Dehinc duae supremae <b>s</b>
et <b>x</b> jure jungentur, nam vicino inter se sonore attracto sibilant
rictu, ita tamen si prioris ictus pone dentes excitatus ad medium lenis
agitetur; sequentis autem crasso spiritu hispidum sonet qui per
conjunctionem <b>c</b> et <b>s</b>, quarum et locum implet et vim
exprimit, ut sensu aurium ducamur efficitur.
</blockquote>

<p>Again:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Id. ib. p.&nbsp;5.</small>] <b>X</b> autem per <b>c</b> et
<b>s</b> possemus scribere.
</blockquote>

<p>
<span class = "pagenum">38</span>
And:</p>

<blockquote>
Posteaquam a Graecis <span class = "greek" lang = "el" title =
"Greek letter xi">ξ</span>, et a nobis <b>x</b>, recepta est, abiit et illorum
et nostra perplexa ratio, et in primis observatio Nigidii, qui in libris

</blockquote>

<p><b>X</b> suffers a long vowel before it, being composed of the
<b>c</b> (the only mute that allows a long vowel before&nbsp;it) and
the&nbsp;<b>s</b>.</p>

<p><b>Z</b> probably had a sound akin to <b>ds</b> in English. After
giving the sound of <b>x</b> as <b>cs</b>, Marius Victorinus goes on to
speak of <b>z</b> thus:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;VI. p.&nbsp;5.</small>] Sic et <b>z</b>, si modo
latino sermoni necessaria esset, per <b>d</b> et <b>s</b> litteras
faceremus.

Quantity.</a></h4>

<p>A syllable in Latin may consist of from one to six letters, as
<i>a</i>, <i>ab</i>, <i>ars</i>, <i>Mars</i>, <i>stans</i>,
<i>stirps</i>.</p>

<p>In dividing into syllables, a consonant between two vowels belongs to
the vowel following it. When there are two consonants, the first goes
with the vowel before, the second with the vowel after, unless the
consonants form such a combination as may stand at the beginning of a
word (Latin or Greek), that is, as may be uttered with a single impulse,
as one letter; in which case they go, as one, with the vowel following.
An apparent exception is made in the case of compound words. These are
divided into their component parts when these parts remain intact.</p>

<p>On these points Priscian says:</p>

<blockquote>
Si antecedens syllaba terminat in consonantem necesse est et sequentem a
consonante incipere; ut <i>artus</i>, <i>ille</i>, <i>arduus</i>; nisi
fit compositum: ut <i>abeo</i>, <i>adeo</i>, <i>pereo</i>.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Nam in simplicibus dictionibus necesse est <b>s</b> et <b>c</b> ejusdem
esse syllabae, ut <i>pascua</i>, <i>luscus</i>.
</blockquote>

<span class = "pagenum">39</span>
<blockquote>
<p><b>M</b> quoque, vel <b>p</b>, vel <b>t</b>, in simplicibus
dictionibus, si antecedat <b>s</b>, ejusdem est syllabae, ut
<i>cosmos</i>, <i>perspirare</i>, <i>testis</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
In semivocalibus similiter sunt praepositivae aliis semivocalibus in
eadem syllaba; ut <b>m</b> sequente <b>n</b>, ut <i>Mnesteus</i>,
<i>amnis</i>.
</blockquote>

<p>Each letter has its ‘time,’ or ‘times.’ Thus a short vowel has the
time of one beat (<i>mora</i>); a long vowel, of two beats;
a&nbsp;single consonant, of a half beat; a&nbsp;double consonant, of one
beat. Theoretically, therefore, a&nbsp;syllable may have as many as
three, or even four, <i>tempora</i>; but practically only two are
recognized. All over two are disregarded and each syllable is simply
counted ‘short’ (one beat) or ‘long’ (two beats).</p>

<p>Priscian says:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;II. p.&nbsp;52.</small>] In longis natura vel
positione duo sunt tempora, ut <i>do</i>, <i>ars</i>; duo semis, quando
post vocalem natura longam una sequitur consonans, ut <i>sol</i>; tria,
quando post vocalem natura longam duae consonantes sequuntur, vel una
duplex, ut <i>mons</i>, <i>rex</i>. Tamen in metro necesse est
unamquamque syllabam vel unius vel duorum accipi temporum.

Accent.</a></h4>

<p>The grammarians tell us that every syllable has three dimensions,
length, breadth and height, or <i>tenor</i>, <i>spiritus</i>,
<i>tempus</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. Supp.&nbsp;p.&nbsp;XVIII.</small>] Habet etiam unaquaeque
syllaba altitudinem, latitudinem et longitudinem; altitudinem in tenore;
crassitudinem vel latitudinem, in spiritu; longitudinem in tempore.
</blockquote>

<p>Diomedes says:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;I. p.&nbsp;430.</small>] Accentus est dictus ab
accinendo, quod sit quasi quidam cujusque syllabae cantus.
</blockquote>

<p>And Cicero:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Cic. Or. XVIII.</small>] Ipsa enim natura, quasi modularetur
hominem orationem, in omni verbo posuit acutam vocem, nec una plus, nec
a postrema syllaba citra tertiam.
</blockquote>

<p>
<span class = "pagenum">40</span>
The grammarians recognize three accents; but practically we need take
account of but two, inasmuch as the third is merely negative. The
syllable having the grave accent is, as we should say, unaccented.</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Diom. Keil. v.&nbsp;I. p.&nbsp;430.</small>] Sunt vero tres,
acutus, gravis, et qui ex duobus constat circumflexus. Ex his, acutus in
correptis semper, interdum productis syllabis versatur; inflexus
(or&nbsp;‘circumflexus’), in his quae producuntur; gravis autem per se
nunquam consistere in ullo verbo potest, sed in his in quibus inflexus
est, aut acutus ceteras syllabas obtinet.
</blockquote>

<p>The same writer thus gives the place of each accent:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;I. p.&nbsp;431.</small>] (Acutus) apud Latinos duo
tantum loca tenent, paenultimum et antepaenultimum; circumflexus autem,
quotlibet syllabarum sit dictio, non tenebit nisi paenultimum locum.
Omnis igitur pars orationis hanc rationem pronuntiationis detinet. Omnis
vox monosyllaba aliquid significans, si brevis est, acuetur, ut
<i>ab</i>, <i>mel</i>, <i>fel</i>; et, si positione longa fuerit, acutum
similiter tenorem habebit, ut <i>ars</i>, <i>pars</i>, <i>pix</i>,
<i>nix</i>, <i>fax</i>. Sin autem longa natura fuerit, flectetur, ut
<i>lux</i>, <i>spes</i>, <i>flos</i>, <i>sol</i>, <i>mons</i>,
<i>fons</i>, <i>lis</i>.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Omnis vox dissyllaba priorem syllabam aut acuit aut flectit. Acuit, vel
cum brevis est utraque, ut <i>deus</i>, <i>citus</i>, <i>datur</i>,
<i>arat</i>; vel cum positione longa est utraque, ut <i>sollers</i>; vel
alterutra positione longa dum ne natura longa sit, prior, ut
<i>pontus</i>; posterior, ut <i>cohors</i>. Si vero prior syllaba natura
longa et sequens brevis fuerit, flectitur prior, ut <i>luna</i>,
<i>Roma</i>.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
In trisyllabis autem et tetrasyllabis et deinceps, secunda ab ultima
semper observanda est. Haec, si natura longa fuerit, inflectitur, ut
<i>Romanus</i>, <i>Cethegus</i>, <i>marinus</i>, <i>Crispinus</i>,
<i>amicus</i>, <i>Sabinus</i>, <i>Quirinus</i>, <i>lectica</i>. Si vero
eadem paenultima positione longa fuerit, acuetur, ut <i>Metellus</i>,
<i>Catullus</i>, <i>Marcellus</i>; ita tamen si positione longa non ex
muta et liquida fuerit. Nam mutabit accentum, ut <i>latebrae</i>,
<i>tenebrae</i>. Et si novissima natura longa itemque paenultima, sive
natura sive positione longa fuerit, paenultima tantum acuetur, non
inflectetur; sic, natura, ut <i>Fidenae</i>,
<span class = "pagenum">41</span>
<i>Athenae</i>, <i>Thebae</i>, <i>Cymae</i>; positione, ut
<i>tabellae</i>, <i>fenestrae</i>. Sin autem media et novissima breves
fuerint, prima servabit acutum tenorem, ut <i>Sergius</i>,
<i>Mallius</i>, <i>ascia</i>, <i>fuscina</i>, <i>Julius</i>,
<i>Claudius</i>. Si omnes tres syllabae longae fuerint, media acuetur,
ut <i>Romani</i>, <i>legati</i>, <i>praetores</i>, <i>praedones</i>.
</blockquote>

<p>Priscian thus defines the accents:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;III. p.&nbsp;519.</small>] Acutus namque accentus
ideo inventus est quod acuat sive elevet syllabam; gravis vero eo quod
deprimat aut deponat; circumflexus ideo quod deprimat et acuat.
</blockquote>

<p>Then after giving the place of the accent he notes some disturbing
influences, which cause exceptions to the general rule:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;III. pp.&nbsp;519-521.</small>] Tres quidem res
accentuum regulas conturbant; distinguendi ratio; pronuntiandi
ambiguitas; atque necessitas.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Ratio namque distinguendi legem accentuum saepe conturbat. Siquis
pronuntians dicat <i>poné</i> et <i>ergó</i>, quod apud Latinos in
ultima syllaba nisi discretionis causa accentus poni non potest: ex hoc
est quod diximus <i>poné</i> et <i>ergó</i>. Ideo <i>poné</i> dicimus ne
putetur verbum esse imperativi modi, hoc est <i>pōne</i>; <i>ergó</i>
ideo dicimus ne putetur conjunctio rationalis, quod est <i>érgo</i>.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Ambiguitas vero pronuntiandi legem accentuum saepe conturbat. Siquis
dicat <i>interealoci</i>, qui nescit, alteram partem dicat
<i>interea</i>, alteram <i>loci</i>, quod non separatim sed sub uno
accentu pronuntiandum est, ne ambiguitatem in sermone faciat.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Necessitas pronuntiationis regulam, corrumpit, ut puta siquis dicat in
primis <i>doctus</i>, addat <i>que</i> conjunctionem, dicatque
<i>doctusque</i>, ecce in pronuntiatione accentum mutavit, cum non in
secunda syllaba, sed in prima, accentum habere debuit.
</blockquote>

<p>He also states the law that determines the kind of accent to be
used:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Id. ib. p.&nbsp;521.</small>] Syllaba quae correptam vocalem
habet acuto accentu pronuntiatur, ut <i>páx</i>, <i>fáx</i>, <i>píx</i>,
<i>níx</i>, <i>dúx</i>, <i>núx</i>, quae etiam tali accentu pronuntianda
est, quamvis sit longa positione, quia
<span class = "pagenum">42</span>
naturaliter brevis est. Quae vero naturaliter producta est circumflexo
accentu exprimenda est ut, <i>rês</i>, <i>dôs</i>, <i>spês</i>.
Dissyllabae vero quae priorem productam habent et posteriorem correptam,
priorem syllabam circumflectunt, ut <i>mêta</i>, <i>Crêta</i>. Illae
vero quae sunt ambae longae vel prior brevis et ulterior longa acuto
accento pronuntiandae sunt, ut <i>népos</i>, <i>léges</i>, <i>réges</i>.
Hae vero quae sunt ambae breves similiter acuto accentu proferuntur, ut
<i>bonus</i>, <i>melos</i>. Sed notandum quod si prior sit longa
positione non circumflexo, sed acuto, accentu pronuntianda est, ut
<i>arma</i>, <i>arcus</i>, quae, quamvis sit longa positione, tamen
exprimenda est tali accentu quia non est naturalis.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Trisyllabae namque et tetrasyllabae sive deinceps, si paenultimam
correptam habuerint, antepaenultimam acuto accentu proferunt, ut
<i>Túllius</i>, <i>Hostílius</i>. Nam paenultima, si positione longa
fuerit, acuetur, antepaenultima vero gravabitur, ut <i>Catúllus</i>,
<i>Metéllus</i>. Si vero ex muta et liquida longa in versu esse constat,
in oratione quoque accentum mutat, ut <i>latébrae</i>, <i>tenébrae</i>.
Syllaba vero ultima, si brevis sit et paenultimam naturaliter longam
habuerit ipsam paenultimam circumflectit, ut <i>Cethêgus</i>,
<i>perôsus</i>. Ultima quoque, si naturaliter longa fuerit, paenultimam
acuet, ut <i>Athénae</i>, <i>Mycénae</i>. Ad hanc autem rem arsis et
thesis necessariae. Nam in unaquaque parte oratione arsis et thesis
sunt, non in ordine syllabarum, sed in pronuntiatione: velut in hac
parte <i>natura</i>, ut quando dico <i>natu</i> elevatur vox, et est
arsis intus; quando vero sequitur <i>ra</i> vox deponitur, et est thesis
deforis. Quantum autem suspenditur vox per arsin tantum deprimitur per
thesin. Sed ipsa vox quae per dictiones formatur donec accentus
perficiatur in arsin deputatur, quae autem post accentum sequitur in
thesin.
</blockquote>

<p>In the matter of exceptions to the rule that accent does not fall on
the ultimate, we find a somewhat wide divergence of opinion among the
grammarians. Some of them give numerous exceptions, particularly in the
distinguishing of parts of speech, as, for instance, between the same
word used as adverb or preposition, as <i>ánte</i> and <i>anté</i>; or
between
<span class = "pagenum">43</span>
the same form as occurring in nouns and verbs, as <i>réges</i> and
<i>regés</i>; and in final syllables contracted or curtailed, as
<i>finīt</i> (for <i>finivit</i>).</p>

<p>But since on this point the grammarians do not agree among
themselves, either as to number or class of exceptions, or even as to
the manner of making them, we may treat this matter as of no great
importance (as&nbsp;in English, we please ourselves in saying
<i>pérfect</i> or <i>perféct</i>). And here it may be said that due
attention to the quantity will of itself often regulate the accent in
doubtful cases; as when we say <i>doce</i>, if we duly shorten the
<b>o</b> and lengthen the <b>e</b> the effect will be correct, whether
the ear of the grammarian detect accent on the final syllable, or not.
For as Quintilian well says:</p>

<blockquote>
Nam ut color oculorum indicio, sapor palati, odor narium dinoscitur, ita
sonus aurium arbitrio subjectus est.
</blockquote>


<h4 class = "smallcaps"><a name = "why_pitch" id = "why_pitch">
Pitch.</a></h4>

<p>But besides the length of the syllable, and the place and quality of
the accent, another matter claims attention.</p>

<p>In English all that is required is to know the place of the accent,
which is simply distinguished by greater stress of voice. This
peculiarity of our language makes it more difficult for us than for
other peoples to get the Latin accent, which is one of pitch.</p>

<p>In Latin the acute accent means that on the syllable thus accented
you raise the pitch; the grave indicates merely the lower tone; the
circumflex, that the voice is first raised, then depressed, on the same
syllable. To quote again the passage from Priscian:</p>

<blockquote>
[<small>Keil. v.&nbsp;III. p.&nbsp;519.</small>] Acutus namque accentus
ideo inventus est quod acuat sive elevet syllabam; gravis vero eo quod
deprimat aut deponet; circumflexus ideo quod deprimat et acuat.

In conclusion of this part of the work the following anecdotes from
Aulus Gellius are given, as serving to show that to the rules of classic
Roman pronunciation there were exceptions, apparently more or less
arbitrary, some&mdash;perhaps many&mdash;of which we may not now hope to
discover; and as serving still more usefully to show, by the stress laid
upon points of comparative insignificance, that exceptions were rare,
such as even scholars could afford to disagree upon, and not such as to
affect the general tenor of the language. So that we are encouraged to
believe that, as the English language may be well and even elegantly
spoken by those whose speech still includes scores, if not hundreds, of
variations in pronunciation, in sounds of letters or in accent, so we
may hope to pronounce the Latin with some good degree of satisfaction,
whether, for instance, we say <i>quiêsco</i> or <i>quiésco</i>,
<i>ăctito</i> or <i>āctito</i>:</p>

<b>HOW TO USE IT.</b></h3>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> directions now to be given may
be fittingly introduced by a few paragraphs from Professor Munro’s
pamphlet on the pronunciation of Latin, already more than once quoted
from. He says&mdash;and part of this has been cited before:</p>

<p>“We know exactly how Cicero or Quintilian did or could spell; we know
the syllable on which they placed the accent of almost every word; and
in almost every case we already follow them in this. I&nbsp;have the
conviction that in their best days philological people took vast pains
to make the writing exactly reproduce the sounding; and that if
Quintilian or Tacitus spelt a word differently from Cicero or Livy, he
also spoke it so far differently. With the same amount of evidence,
direct and indirect, we have for Latin, it would not, I&nbsp;think, be
worth anybody’s while to try to recover the pronunciation of French or
English; it might, I&nbsp;think, be worth his while to try to recover
that of German or Italian, in which sound and spelling accord more
nearly, and accent obeys more determinable laws.”</p>

<p>“I am convinced,” he says in another place, “that the mainstay of an
efficient reform is the adoption essentially of the Italian vowel
system: it combines beauty, firmness and precision in a degree not
equalled by any other system of which I have any knowledge. The little
ragged boys in the streets of Rome and Florence enunciate their vowels
in a style of which princes might be proud.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">47</span>
<p>And again:</p>

<p>“I do not propose that every one should learn Italian in order to
learn Latin. What I would suggest is, that those who know Italian should
make use of their knowledge and should in many points take Italian
sounds for the model to be followed; that those who do not know it
should try to learn from others the sounds required, or such an
approximation to them as may be possible in each case.”</p>

<p>We may then sum up the results at which we have arrived in the
following directions:</p>

<p>First of all pay particular attention to the vowel sounds, to make
them full and distinct, taking the Italian model, if you know Italian,
and always observing strictly the quantity.</p>

<p>Pronounce</p>

<div class = "list">
<p><b>ā</b> as in Italian <i>fato</i>; or as final <b>a</b> in aha!</p>

<p><b>ă</b> as in Italian <i>fatto</i>; or as initial <b>a</b> in aha!
or as in fast (not as in fat).</p>

<p><b>ē</b> as second <b>e</b> in Italian <i>fedele</i>; or as in fête
(not fate); or as in vein.</p>

<p><b>ĕ</b> as in Italian <i>fetta</i>; or as in very.</p>

<p><b>ī</b> as first <b>i</b> in Italian <i>timide</i>; or as in
caprice.</p>

<p><b>ĭ</b> as second <b>i</b> in Italian <i>timide</i>; or as in
capricious.</p>

<p><b>ĭ</b> or <b>ŭ</b>, where the spelling varies between the two (e.g.
<i>maximus</i>, <i>maxumus</i>), as in German Müller.</p>

<p><b>ō</b> as first <b>o</b> in Italian <i>orlo</i>; or as in more.</p>

<p><b>ŏ</b> as first <b>o</b> in Italian <i>rotto</i>; or as in wholly
(not as in holly).</p>

<p><b>ū</b> as in Italian <i>rumore</i>; or as in rural,</p>

<p><b>ŭ</b> as in Italian <i>ruppe</i>; or as in puss (not as in
fuss).</p>
</div>

<p>Let <b>i</b> in <b>vĭ</b> before <b>d</b>, <b>t</b>, <b>m</b>,
<b>r</b> or <b>x</b>, in the first syllable of a word, be pronounced
quite obscurely, somewhat as first <b>i</b> in virgin.</p>

<p>In the matter of diphthongs, be sure to take always the correct
spelling, to begin with, and thus avoid what Munro
<span class = "pagenum">48</span>
justly terms “hateful barbarisms like <i>coelum</i>, <i>coena</i>,
<i>moestus</i>.” Much time is wasted by students and bad habits are
acquired in not finding, at the outset, the right spelling of each word
and holding to it. This each student must do for himself, consulting a
good dictionary, as editors and editions are not always to be depended
on. Here it is the diphthongs that present the chief difficulty and call
for the greatest care.</p>

<p>In pronouncing diphthongs sound both vowels, but glide so rapidly
from the first to the second as to offer to the ear but a single sound.
In the publication of the Cambridge (Eng.) Philological Society on
“Pronunciation of Latin in the Augustan Period,” the following
directions are given:</p>

<p>“The pronunciation of these diphthongs, of which the last three are
extremely rare, is best learnt by first sounding each vowel separately
and then running them together, <b>ae</b> as ah-eh, <b>au</b> as ah-oo,
<b>oe</b> as o-eh, <b>ei</b> as eh-ee, <b>eu</b> as eh-oo, and <b>ui</b>
as oo-ee.”</p>

<p>Thus:</p>

<table summary = "pronunciations">
<tr>
<td class = "letter">ae</td>
<td>
<p>(ah-éh) as in German <i>näher</i>; or as <b>ea</b> in pear; or

in aisle).</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td class = "letter">ei</td>
<td>
<p>(eh-ée) nearly as in veil. (In <i>dein</i>, <i>deinde</i>, the

distinct syllable, is elided.)</p>

<i>proinde</i>, the <b>o</b> is either elided or forms a distinct

either elided or forms a distinct syllable.)</p>

<span class = "pagenum">49</span>
<p>In the pronunciation of consonants certain points claim special
attention. And first among these is the sounding of the doubled
consonants. Whoever has heard Italian spoken recognizes one of its
greatest beauties to be the distinctness, yet smoothness, with which its
<b>ll</b> and <b>rr</b> and <b>cc</b>&mdash;in short, all its doubled
consonants&mdash;are pronounced. No feature of the language is more
charming. And one who attempts the same in Latin and perseveres, with
whatever difficulty and pains, will be amply rewarded in the music of
the language.</p>

<p>A good working rule for pronouncing doubled consonants is to hold the
first until ready to pronounce the second: as in the words <i>we’ll lie
till late</i>, not to be pronounced as <i>we lie till eight</i>.</p>

<p>Next in importance, and, in New England at least, first in
difficulty, is the trilling of the&nbsp;<b>r</b>. There can be no
approximation to a satisfactory pronunciation of Latin until this
<b>r</b> is acquired; but the satisfaction in the result when
accomplished is well worth all the pains taken.</p>

<p>Another point to be observed is that the dentals <b>t</b>, <b>d</b>,
<b>n</b>, <b>l</b>, require that the tongue touch the teeth, rather than
the palate. Munro says: “<b>d</b> and <b>t</b> we treat with our usual
slovenliness, and force them up to the roof of our mouth: we should make
them real dentals, as no doubt the Romans made them, and then we shall
see how readily <i>ad at</i>, <i>apud aput</i>, <i>illud illut</i> and
the like interchange.” This requires care, but amply repays the
effort.</p>

<p>It is necessary also to remember that <b>n</b> before a guttural is
pronounced as in the same position in English, e.g., in <i>ancora</i> as
in anchor; in <i>anxius</i> as in anxious; in <i>relinquo</i> as in
relinquish.</p>

<p>Remember to make <b>n</b> before <b>f</b> or <b>s</b> a mere nasal,
having as little prominence otherwise as possible, and to carefully
lengthen the preceding vowel.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">50</span>
<p>Studiously observe the length of the vowel before the terminations
<i>gnus</i>, <i>gna</i>, <i>gnum</i>.</p>

<p>Remember that the final syllable in <b>m</b>, when not elided, is to
be pronounced as lightly and rapidly as possible, the more lightly and
indistinctly the better.</p>

<p>Remember that <b>s</b> must not be pronounced as <b>z</b>, except
where it represents <b>z</b> in Greek words, as Smyrna (Zmyrna),
Smaragdus (Zmaragdus), otherwise always pronounce as in sis.</p>

<p>Remember in pronouncing <b>v</b> to direct the lower lip toward the
upper lip, avoiding the upper teeth.</p>

<p>As Professor Ellis well puts it: “No relaxation of the organs, no
puff of wind or grunt of voice should intervene between the two parts of
a doubled consonant, which should more resemble separated parts of one
articulation than two separate articulations.”</p>

<p>“Duplication of consonants is consequently regarded simply as the
energetic utterance of a single consonant.”</p>


<h4 class = "smallcaps"><a name = "how_elision" id = "how_elision">
Elision.</a></h4>

<p>Professor Ellis believes that the <b>m</b> was always omitted in
speaking and the following consonant pronounced as if doubled (<i>quorum
pars</i> as <i>quoruppars</i>). Final <b>m</b> at the end
<span class = "pagenum">52</span>
of a sentence he thinks was not heard at all. Where a vowel followed he
thinks that the <b>m</b> was not heard, the vowel before being slurred
on to the initial vowel of the following word.</p>

<p>The Cambridge (Eng.) Philological Society, however, takes the view
that “final vowels (or&nbsp;diphthongs) when followed by vowels
(or&nbsp;diphthongs) were not cut off, but lightly run on to the
following word, as in Italian. But if the vowel was the same the effect
was that of a single sound.”</p>

<p>Professor Munro says:</p>

<p>“In respect of elision I would only say that, by comparing Plautus
with Ovid, we may see how much the elaborate cultivation of the language
had tended to a more distinct sounding of final syllables; and that but
for Virgil’s powerful influence the elision of long vowels would have
almost ceased. Clearly we must not altogether pass over the elided vowel
or syllable in <b>m</b>, except perhaps in the case of <b>ĕ</b> in
common words, <i>que</i>, <i>neque</i>, and the like.”</p>

<p>This view, held by the Cambridge Philological Society and by
Professor Munro, is the one generally accepted; the practice recommended
by them is the one generally in use, and that which seems safe and
suitable to follow. That is: Do not altogether pass over the elided
vowel or syllable in <b>m</b>, except in cases of very close connection,
in compound words or phrases, or when the final and initial vowel are
the same, or in the case of <b>ĕ</b> final in common words, as
<i>que</i>, <i>neque</i>, and the like; but let the final vowel run
lightly on to the following vowel as in Italian, and touch lightly and
obscurely the final syllable in&nbsp;<b>m</b>. The <b>o</b> or <b>e</b>
of <i>proin</i>, <i>proinde</i>, <i>prout</i>, <i>dein</i>,
<i>deinde</i>, <i>neuter</i>, <i>neutiquam</i>, when not forming a
distinct syllable, are to be treated as cases of elision between two
words.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">53</span>
<h4 class = "smallcaps"><a name = "how_quantity" id = "how_quantity">
Quantity.</a></h4>

<p>In the pronunciation of Latin the observance of quantity and of pitch
are the two most difficult points of attainment; and they are the
crucial test of good reading.</p>

<p>The observance of quantity is no less important in prose than in
verse. A&nbsp;little reflection will convince the dullest mind that the
Romans did not pronounce a word one way in prose and another in verse;
that we have not in poetry and prose two languages. Cicero and
Quintilian both enjoin a due admixture of long and short syllables in
prose as well as verse; and any one who takes delight in reading Latin
will heartily agree with Professor Munro when he says: “For myself, by
observing quantity, I&nbsp;seem to feel more keenly the beauty of
Cicero’s style and Livy’s, as well as Virgil’s and Horace’s.”</p>

<p>Therefore until one feels at home with the quantities, let him
observe the rule of beating time in reading, to make sure that the long
syllables get twice the time of the short ones. In this way he will soon
have the pronunciation of each word correctly fixed in mind, and will
not be obliged to think of his quantities in verse more than in prose.
A&nbsp;long step has been taken in the enjoyment of Latin poetry when
the reader does not have to be thinking of the ‘feet.’</p>

<p>Young students particularly should be especially careful in the final
syllable of the verse. Since, so far as the measure is concerned, there
is no difference there between the long and the short syllable, the
reader is apt to be careless as to the length of the syllable itself,
and to make all final syllables long, even to the mispronouncing of the
word, thereby both making a false quantity and otherwise injuring the
effect of the verse, by importing into it a monotony foreign to the
original. Does not Cicero himself say that
<span class = "pagenum">54</span>
a short syllable at the end of the verse is as if you ‘stood’ (came to a
stand), but a long one as if you ‘sat down’?</p>

<p>It is, in fact, in the pronouncing of final syllables everywhere that
the most serious and persistent faults are found, <i>būs</i> for
<i>bŭs</i> being one of the worst and most common cases. How much of the
teacher’s time might be spared, for better things, if he did not have to
correct <i>būs</i> into <i>bŭs!</i></p>

<p>The disposition to neglect the double and doubled consonants is
another serious fault, as well as the slovenly pronunciation of two
consonants, where the reader fails to give the time necessary to speak
each distinctly, making false quantity and mispronunciation at the same
time.</p>

<p>In general, if two symbols are written we are to infer that two
sounds were intended. The only exception to this is in the case of a few
words where the spelling varies, as <i>casso</i> or <i>caso</i>. In such
cases we may suppose that the doubled consonant was only designed to
indicate length.</p>

<p>Another, apparent, exception is in the case of a mute followed by a
liquid; but the mute and liquid are regularly sounded as one, and
therefore do not affect the length of the preceding vowel. Sometimes,
however, for the sake of time, the verse requires them to be pronounced
separately. In this case each is to be given distinctly; the mute and
liquid must not coalesce. For it must not be forgotten that, as a rule,
the vowel before a mute followed by a liquid is short, in which case it
must on no account be lengthened. Thus, ordinarily, we say
<i>pă-tris</i>, but the verse may require <i>pat-ris</i>.</p>

<p>Although the vowel before two consonants is generally short, we find,
in some instances, a&nbsp;long vowel in this position. For example, it
would appear that the vowel of the supine and cognate parts of the verb
is long if the vowel of the present indicative, though short, is
followed by a medial (<b>b</b>, <b>g</b>, <b>d</b>, <b>z</b>), as
<i>āctus</i>, <i>lēctus</i>, from <i>ăgo</i>, <i>lĕgo</i>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">55</span>
<p>Let it be remembered in the matter of <i>i</i> consonant between two
vowels, that we have really the force of two <b>ii</b>’s, as originally
written, one, vowel, making a diphthong with the preceding, the other,
consonant, introducing the new syllable; and that the same is true of
the compounds of <i>jacio</i>, which should be written with a single
<b>i</b> but pronounced as with two, as <i>obicit</i>
(<i>objicit</i>).</p>


<h4 class = "smallcaps"><a name = "how_accent" id = "how_accent">
Accent.</a></h4>

<p>The question of accent presents little difficulty as to place, but
some as to quality, and much as to kind.</p>

<p>As to quality, it must be remembered that while the acute accent is
found on syllables either short or long (by&nbsp;nature or position),
and on either the penult or the antepenult, the circumflex is found only
on long vowels, and (in&nbsp;words of more than one syllable) only on
the penult, and then only in case the ultima is short. Thus,
<i>spês</i>, but <i>dúx</i>; <i>lûnă</i>, but <i>lúnā</i>;
<i>legâtus</i>, but <i>legáti</i>. In these examples the length of the
syllable is the same and of course remains the same in inflection, but
the quality of the accent changes. In the one case the voice is both
raised and depressed on the same syllable, in the other it is only
raised. As Professor Ellis puts it: “If the last syllable but one is
long, it is spoken with a raised pitch, which is maintained throughout
if its vowel is short, as: <i>véntōs</i>, or if the last syllable is
long, as: <i>fāmāe</i>; but sinks immediately if its own vowel is long,
and at the same time the vowel of the last syllable is short, as
<i>fâmă</i>, to be distinguished from <i>fā́mā</i>.”</p>

<p>But when we come to the question of the <i>kind</i> of accent, we
come upon the most serious matter practically in the pronunciation of
Latin, and this because of a difficulty peculiar to the English speaking
peoples. The English accent is one of <i>stress</i>, whereas the Roman
is one of <i>pitch</i>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">56</span>
<p>No one will disagree with Professor Ellis when he “assumes,” in his
Quantitative Pronunciation of Latin, “that the Augustan Romans had
<i>no</i> force accent, that is, that they did not, as we do,
distinguish one syllable in every word <i>invariably</i> by pronouncing
it with greater force, that is, with greater loudness, than the others,
but that the force varied according to the feeling of the moment, or the
beat of the timekeeper in singing, and was used for purposes of
expression; just as with us, musical pitch is free, that is, just as we
may pronounce the same word with different musical pitches for its
different syllables, and in fact are obliged to vary the musical pitch
in interrogations and replies. The fixity of musical pitch and freedom
of degrees of force in Latin, and the freedom of musical pitch and
fixity of degrees of force in English sharply distinguish the two
pronunciations even irrespective of quantity.”</p>

<p>But this pitch accent, while alien to us, is not impossible of
acquisition, and it is essential to any adequate rendering of any Latin
writer, whether of prose or verse. Nor will the attainment be a work of
indefinite time if one pursues with constancy some such course as the
following, recommended by Professor Ellis:</p>

<p>“The place of raised pitch,” he says, “must be strictly observed, and
for this purpose the verses had better be first read in a kind of
sing-song, the high pitched syllables being all of one pitch and the low
pitched syllables being all of one pitch also, but about a musical
‘fifth’ lower than the other, as if the latter were sung to the lowest
note of the fourth string of a violin, and the former were sung to the
lowest note of its third string.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the foregoing pages an effort has been made to bring together
compactly and to set forth concisely the nature of
<span class = "pagenum">57</span>
the ‘Roman method’ of pronouncing Latin; the reasons for adopting, and
the simplest means of acquiring it. No attempt has been made at a
philosophical or exhaustive treatment of the subject; but at the same
time it is hoped that nothing unphilosophical has crept in, or anything
been omitted, which might have been given, to render the subject
intelligible and enable the intelligent reader to understand the points
and be able to give a reason for each usage herein recommended.</p>

<p>The main object in view in preparing this little book has been to
help the teachers of Latin in the secondary schools, to furnish them
something not too voluminous, yet as satisfactory as the nature of the
case allows, upon a subject which the present diversity of opinion and
practice has rendered unnecessarily obscure.</p>

<p>To these teachers, then, a word from Professor Ellis may be fitly
spoken in conclusion:</p>

<p>“To teach a person to read prose <i>well</i>, even in his own
language, is difficult, partly because he has seldom heard prose well
read, though he is constantly hearing prose around him, intonated, but
unrhythmical. In the case of a dead language, like the Latin, which the
pupil never hears spoken, and seldom hears read, except by himself or
his equally ignorant and hobbling fellow-scholars, this difficulty is
inordinately increased. Let me once more impress on every teacher of
Latin the <i>duty</i> of himself learning to read Latin readily
according to accent and quantity; the <i>duty</i> of his reading out to
his pupils, of his setting them a <i>pattern</i>, of his hearing that
they follow it, of his correcting their mistakes, of his <i>leading</i>
them into right habits. If the quantitative pronunciation be adopted, no
one will be fit to become a classical teacher who cannot read a simple
Latin sentence decently, with a strict observance of that
<span class = "pagenum">58</span>
quantity by which alone the greatest of Latin orators regulated his own
rhythms.”</p>

<p>“All pronunciation is acquired by imitation, and it is not till after
hearing a sound many times that we are able to grasp it sufficiently
well to imitate. It is a mistake constantly made by teachers of language
to suppose that a pupil knows by once hearing unfamiliar sounds, or even
unfamiliar combinations of familiar sounds. When pupils are made to
imitate too soon, they acquire an erroneous pronunciation, which they
afterward hear constantly from themselves actually or mentally, and
believe that they hear from the teacher during the small fraction of a
second that each sound lasts, and hence the habits of these organs
become fixed.”</p>

<p>The following direction is of the utmost importance (Curwen’s
“Standard Course,” p.&nbsp;3): “The teacher never sings (speaks)
<i>with</i> his pupils, but sings (utters, reads, dictates) to them a
brief and soft <i>pattern</i>. The first art of the pupil is to
<i>listen well</i> to the pattern, and then to imitate it exactly. He
that listens best sings (speaks) best.”</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
